KUHAB se concentre sur les pratiques culturelles, sociales et spatiales dans le monde rural Projet semestre de l'automne et du printemps :
L'atelier pratique le projet en alternance dans un site rural (un village) et un site urbain.
L'idée est de prendre connaissance de la culture du bâti en traversant de façon détaillée un village à travers sa morphologie et typologie.
De comprendre les relations entre le bâti et le territoire et de projeter avec les outils du monde moderne des pratiques mélangeant vie publique et vie privée en extension de structures rurales existantes, et au deuxième semestre, de projeter ces acquis dans le monde de la ville dense.
Pour ceci un site est choisi, une parcelle en "dent creuse" par exemple, qui sert de terroir pour le développement d'un projet de logement dense en site productiviste.
Autumn and spring semester project:
The workshop practices the project alternately in a rural site (a village) and an urban site.
The idea is to learn about the culture of the built environment by exploring a village in detail through its morphology and typology.
To understand the relationships between the built environment and the territory and to project, with the tools of the modern world, practices mixing public and private life in extension of existing rural structures, and in the second semester, to project these acquired skills into the world of the dense city.
For this, a site is chosen, a "hollow tooth" plot for example, which serves as a terroir for the development of a dense housing project in a productivist site.
Le projet de transformation considère les sites existants comme des ressources pour réinventer nos manières d'habiter.
À Renens, les étudiants exploreront la rénovation pour concevoir de nouvelles formes de vie, créant des typologies domestiques issues des structures et contextes existants.
The project of transformation begins with the recognition that our existing buildings, landscapes, and infrastructures are valuable resources for reimagining how we live today.
Instead of producing new, "finished" buildings, we will explore renovation and transformation as ways to respond to ecological urgency, cultural memory, and changing needs.
This means working with what already exists, preserving, dismantling, reusing, or transforming, while carefully deciding the extent and necessity of each intervention.
Adaptive reuse is not just technical but cultural:
it negotiates between past and future, old and new, and creates unexpected relationships across scales, from a construction detail to the regional landscape.
The goal is to imagine architecture as open, adaptable, and unfinished, able to evolve over time.
Living spaces, too, are not fixed.
Standard housing often reduces life to predictable patterns, but adaptive reuse opens the door to alternative forms of domesticity:
a factory as a home, a courtyard as a kitchen, a rooftop as a garden.
To live today may mean inhabiting porous, flexible spaces shaped by light, air, water, and time.
Together, we will work on sites in Renens, close by to be able to often access, the site and developp a precise site analysis, We will be, developing projects that combine existing structures with lessons from architectural case studies.
Through models, drawings, and experiments, students will create new typologies of living that balance inside and outside, the tectonic and the organic, and the real and the imagined.
In this studio, students will establish the foundational comprehending needed to design collective housing typologies by understanding and applying Louis Kahn's principles of "served and servant spaces.
HOUSING TYPOLOGY:
SERVANT SERVED SPACES SEMESTER I The concepts of "servant space" and "served space," originally formulated by Louis I.
Kahn, offer a valuable framework for interpreting and designing collective housing projects through their floor plans.
This distinction isn't just about programmatic function;
it primarily refers to a fundamental design strategy.
Servant spaces generally encompass all functional and utilitarian components of a home.
This includes circulation areas, built-in installations, "wet" cores (such as bathrooms and kitchens), and storage areas for both maintenance tools and personal belongings.
Conversely, served spaces are the remaining areas - often considered the "negative" space - designed for both interaction and privacy.
The structure of a floor plan can be defined by how servant spaces are strategically located, or by how served spaces are created through "emptying" processes.
For instance, a kitchen might be contained entirely within a servant space, or it could open to expand the served space, making it more permeable.
Whether an element is a service or a served element is not so much determined by its use as by its relative position and interaction within the overall layout.
EXERCISE 1 Our semester will start with a two-day visit to Zurich, focusing on recent collective and cooperative housing projects with innovative typologies.
For the initial exercise, students will individually analyse a provided reference typology through the lens of servant and served spaces.
The primary objective is to study the relationship between these two complementary space types by examining their proportion, formalization, and arrangement within the floor plan.
Beyond simply identifying these spaces, this exercise aims to foster a discourse that doesn't just categorize but rather observes how the relationship between servant and served spaces influences the way we inhabit our homes.
This exercise will conclude at the midterm, at which point students will submit a vertical sheet.
This sheet should include a floor plan of both the typology and the complete building, relevant elevations or sections, and an axonometric drawing.
The axonometric drawing should specifically explain the role of either the servant or served space in the overall structure of both the building and its typology.
Though this information may originate from several documents, it must be composed as a single, cohesive drawing on the sheet.
EXERCISE 2 Before completing the first exercise, students will begin Exercise 2, a two-person group assignment.
They'll design a building for three families, including shared spaces.
While there's no specific physical site, the building will be defined by party walls with varying dimensions on each side of the plot, allowing it to connect with other groups' designs The core idea here is to apply the servant and served space strategy analysed in the reference to this concrete case.
The assignment also proposes shared housing to encourage exploration of the challenges and potential of communal living, including the complexities of space privacy.
Finally, by adapting to existing party walls, students will understand that a building isn't an isolated entity;
it's part of a larger whole that contributes to shape the city.
Â For the final submission of this exercise, students will submit two vertical sheets.
These sheets should include floor plans, elevations, sections, and an axonometric drawing, presented in a manner analogous to the previous exercise, where all documents are composed into a single, cohesive drawing.
Additionally, a 1:33 model will be required.
All models from the studio will be presented together to form an aggregation, and by fitting their party walls together, we'll observe how the sum of individual decisions can collectively generate a city SEMESTER II The second semester's exercise will continue to be a partner assignment, with the same pairs as the first semester.
The semester will kick off with a trip to Barcelona.
Besides visiting innovative housing projects throughout the city, we'll also visit the Can Batllo site.
This former textile factory in Barcelona's Sants neighbourhood is currently undergoing a transformation, turning the entire area into a superblock.
This presents an opportunity to add new buildings to the perimeters and rehabilitate existing warehouses for housing.
The Superblock is an urban pacification strategy in Barcelona, designed to shift urban mobility priorities.
It emphasizes creating green axes and squares by reorganizing traffic:
distinguishing main city-crossing roads from discontinuous local streets reserved for residents.
This reduction in vehicular priority on local streets allows for re-naturalization and increased biodiversity.
It improves water infiltration and flood management by incorporating three layers of vegetation (trees, shrubs, and herbs).
These layers absorb CO2 and other greenhouse gases, regulate the urban microclimate, and mitigate the urban heat island effect by reducing temperatures.
This approach creates a 21st-century street concept:
quieter, cooler, and with better air quality.
Homes can then reconsider their external interaction, reducing reliance on mechanical air conditioning and encouraging passive strategies for energy efficiency and urban sustainability.
The Superblock is a concept, a paradigm, but also the location of the project.
This programme will take an in-depth look at collective housing, focusing mainly on the aggregation of typologies to create shared spaces.
We will understand the thermodynamic performance of these spaces, considering their energy efficiency and comfort.
In addition, the programme will explore the structural logic of spatial systems, examining how elements are organised and interconnected.
We will also consider the aesthetics of building systems, investigating how materials and construction techniques contribute to the overall visual experience.
Finally, we will integrate the concepts of - served and serving spaces,- explored in the previous semester, to understand their functional relationships and how they enhance the way we live.
For the final submission, a 1:300 scale group model of the industrial complex will be required.
You'll also need to generate at least four vertical documents:
a Site Plan, Inhabited Plans, Elevations and Sections, and a Constructive Axonometric.
Finally, a 1:33 scale model of the Project must be produced.
Par une approche à différentes échelles d'intervention - du projet urbain au détail constructif - l'atelier vise à explorer les stratégies architecturales permettant de régénérer les territoires urbains à proximité des transports publics dans une optique de transition vers la durabilité.
Les activités de l'atelier se conçoivent comme une synergie entre des apports théoriques interdisciplinaires et l'expérimentation concrète de leur intégration dans le projet architectural.
Cette double approche permet d'aborder les questions de cohérence conceptuelle, spatiale, expressive et constructive, tout en explorant simultanément les modalités permettant aux enjeux de durabilité de devenir une "matière première" pour l'architecte.
Il s'agit en particulier d'étudier les interactions entre les questions de densité, de mixité et de qualité de vie, de projeter des bâtiments intégrant des principes d'architecture bioclimatique et de développer des détails constructifs en accord avec les notions de base de la durabilité et de la décarbonation du bâti.
Les exercices de projet reposent sur la recherche de stratégies architecturales adaptées à la transformation d'un site à caractère urbain, présentant une certaine densité et regroupant diverses fonctions.
Ils sont élaborés de manière itérative à l'échelle spécifique de la morphologie, de l'ensemble bâti, du bâtiment, de la typologie et de l'enveloppe.
A house is the simple topic of this studio.
A matter of simple complexity.
Learning about a house is learning about architecture.
The first part of the year is about learning about a house.
The second part is about making your house.
LEARNING ABOUT A HOUSE MAKING YOUR OWN HOUSE Studio jo taillieu - LIF composes with the idea of the reference, your personal frame of reference, but also its place within architectural practice.
The studio teaches a methodology of composition and construction detail.
Constructing architecture starts from the small scale, the detail, towards the bigger scale, the whole.
It allows one to understand how a detail can give qualities to a space as much as a whole constructive system for a whole building.
Observation and contemplation are key, rather than analyzing.
Imagination, rather than concept.
These attitudes are part of the studio methodology.
This studio believes strongly in the variety of media:
from handmade drawing and crafted modeling to digital and analog drawings.
Mediums are not only a result but rather an ongoing method to think, compose, and conceive your architectural intervention.
Your hand is a tool, an instrument on the table to conceive your vision.

A way of thinking by drawing.
This course explores how we can imagine, design, and demonstrate new models of affordable, low-impact living on agroecological farm sites in the UK.
Drawing on local resources vernacular techniques and contemporary technologies to improve the living conditions of a new generation of farmers.
Living in a Material WorldAutumn 2025 - Spring 2026 Teaching TeamJames Binning, james.binning@epfl.chAmy Perkins, amy.perkins@epfl.chCamille Sineau, camille.sineau@epfl.chNoémie Zurbriggen, noemie.zurbriggen@epfl.ch Teaching language This class is taught in English but French is supported where necessary.
Course description Small agroecological farms offer a rich and rewarding way of life but rarely generate enough income to enable those who work on them to compete in the open housing market.
Where affordable housing exists, it is often low quality or far from small farm sites.
Housing supply in rural areas is constrained by planning restrictions and competition from recent arrivals, holiday lets, and second-home ownership.
Many small farm stewards are forced to live long-term in caravans and mobile homes designed for temporary use.
These are often cold, damp, poorly insulated, and expensive to heat.
Their construction makes them difficult to maintain or adapt, and they typically lack essential spaces such as storage, drying areas for active outdoor lives, and warm, dry offices.
For those with caring responsibilities or plans to start families, such housing is particularly inadequate.
This situation is incompatible with the regenerative values at the heart of agroecological farming, which aims to care for land and ecosystems while cycling and stewarding resources responsibly.
This course explores how we might imagine, design, and demonstrate new models of affordable, low-impact living on agroecological farm sites in the South of England.
Our work will draw on locally available materials and resources, combining vernacular techniques with contemporary technologies to improve the conditions in which a new generation of skilled ecological farm workers are able to live and work.
The course is structured around three briefs across the year:Winter Semester:
Brief 1 & 2Spring Semester:
Brief 3 Brief 1:
Learning from ExamplesStudents begin by researching historical and contemporary rural housing projects.
Througharchival work and the production of drawings and models, we will explore andexamine the potential that these projects have to inform contemporary approachesto living on the land and supporting ways of living as part of a system of agroecological production.
Brief 2:
Good TranslationsStudents will investigate how materials and simple energy principles shape territories, economies, and ecologies.
Through an understanding of locally available resources, historic vernacular building practices, and the application of a series of different energy principles, students will translate their precedent projects into characterful, low energy housing proposals that investigate the relationship between how we inhabit and use buildings and the performance of fabric.
Brief 3:
Home LandingThis brief focuses on situating and adapting all the translated design proposals into robust, adaptable housing proposals for rural workers that can be applied across small agroecological farm sites.
Emphasis is placed on using local resources, simple construction techniques, and low-energy strategies that explore the relationship between inhabitation, building use, and fabric performance.
Students will consolidate their previous work into architectural frameworks that articulate clear spatial, material, and environmental principles, while remaining responsive to different contexts.
The refined housing proposals from the previous brief will be located on selected UK agroecological farms and adapted to the realities of a particular site.
The aim is to develop and demonstrate how these housing proposals function as both an architectural and territorial system, responsive to land, resources, energy, regulations, and community, while communicating its potential for adaptation and implementation by others.
SiteWe will work in the South of the United Kingdom in a rural context, specifically agroecological small farm sites.
Study TripThere will be one/two study trips including the opportunity to travel to the UK and/or in Switzerland.
Material & Travel CostsA provisional budget ranging from 250 CHF to 450 CHF is to be considered for each study trip depending on destination.
There will be some additional costs for workshops and materials, including the production of models that we are trying to reduce by mutualising expenses across the studio.
Le studio se concentre sur l'imaginaire contextuel.
Le développement de narratifs inspirés à la fois d'un site et de l'imagination de l'étudiant-e conduit à un thème qui guide le processus créatif.
L'idée architecturale émerge d'un contexte donné.
Urban Legends - London Le studio adresse la complexité du contexte comme source de développement de projets.
Cette approche de mise en relief dévoile les qualités inhérentes à un lieu, puis y intègre des projections ou aspirations personnelles.
Ce processus s'inscrit dans une ambition large d'une reconnexion à un environnement porteur de sens.
Recherche de sens En ce temps de crise, notre mode de vie est réévalué.
La qualité de notre relation à la ville, au territoire, notre façon de vivre et d'habiter sont interrogées.
Une piste de réflexion pourrait être l'idée du soin, émise par Martin Heidegger, et qui induit une notion d'échange avec l'environnement.
Une autre serait la résonance, dont parle Hartmut Rosa, qui voit une perspective dans la redéfinition de notre rapport au monde.
C'est sur cette toile de fond que nous aimerions adresser la question du lien à notre environnement.
Comment l'architecte peut-elle ou peut-il générer des accroches pour rendre des lieux lisibles, poreux et appropriables en leur conférant un sens personnel et à la fois collectif ?
Transpositions La ville de Londres nous offrira l'occasion d'appréhender plusieurs langages d'architecture.
Au cours du semestre, des fragments de ville, des encorbellements, fenêtres en saillie, et bow-windows seront étudiés et extraits de leur contexte.
Ils deviendront les objets insolites susceptibles de générer des propositions d'interventions particulières et collectives à Lausanne.
Les projets comprendront du logement et un programme libre proposé par l'étudiant-e en cohérence avec son narratif.
Au 2e semestre, nous poursuivrons l'exploration de la rénovation à Renens, centrée sur les espaces d'apprentissage.
Comment dépasser les standards scolaires figés pour imaginer des lieux réversibles, modulaires et ouverts, où l'éducation peut se déployer dans des formes multiples ?
In the 2nd semester, we'll continue the explosion of building renovation and transformation in Renens with a focus on spaces of learning.
Today, many disciplines, including architecture, are questioning the role of standards.
These standards, whether criticized for their negative economic impact or for homogenizing cultures and practices, are intended to reassure us and offer guarantees.
But what guarantees are we truly seeking?
Imagine a classroom with 12 tables, 24 chairs lined up, a blackboard, and a window.
A wide staircase leads to a central shared space where coat racks are located.
Surrounding this space are four classrooms, each measuring 80 square meters, providing 4 square meters per pupil.
Ideally, these rooms would have windows glazed to a height of 80 cm and face different directions.
However, the traditional layout is not conducive to pedagogical interaction.
The teacher typically occupies the floor space at the front of the class.
What if we reimagined these spaces?
Public buildings could be designed to serve multiple purposes, and be reversible, allowing their functions to change without disrupting the entire building.
Flexible, modular spaces with good lighting and acoustics could be created to support a wide range of activities.
We might envision learning under a tree, or holding classes on the sports hall's stands, which could also serve as a theater.
Students could learn to count in workshops dedicated to ceramics, wood, and metal.
It all starts with education.
In this studio, students will establish the foundational comprehending needed to design collective housing typologies by understanding and applying Louis Kahn's principles of "served and servant spaces.
HOUSING TYPOLOGY:

L'idée architecturale émerge d'un contexte donné.
Urban Legends - London Le studio adresse la complexité du contexte comme source de développement de projets.
Cette approche de mise en relief dévoile les qualités inhérentes à un lieu, puis y intègre des projections ou aspirations personnelles.
Ce processus s'inscrit dans une ambition large d'une reconnexion à un environnement porteur de sens.
Recherche de sens En ce temps de crise, notre mode de vie est réévalué.
La qualité de notre relation à la ville, au territoire, notre façon de vivre et d'habiter sont interrogées.
Une piste de réflexion pourrait être l'idée du soin, émise par Martin Heidegger, et qui induit une notion d'échange avec l'environnement.
Une autre serait la résonance, dont parle Hartmut Rosa, qui voit une perspective dans la redéfinition de notre rapport au monde.
C'est sur cette toile de fond que nous aimerions adresser la question du lien à notre environnement.
Comment l'architecte peut-elle ou peut-il générer des accroches pour rendre des lieux lisibles, poreux et appropriables en leur conférant un sens personnel et à la fois collectif ?
Transpositions La ville de Londres nous offrira l'occasion d'appréhender plusieurs langages d'architecture.
Au cours du semestre, des fragments de ville, des encorbellements, fenêtres en saillie, et bow-windows seront étudiés et extraits de leur contexte.
Ils deviendront les objets insolites susceptibles de générer des propositions d'interventions particulières et collectives à Lausanne.
Les projets comprendront du logement et un programme libre proposé par l'étudiant-e en cohérence avec son narratif.
La Stéréotomie est l'art de concevoir et fabriquer des volumes complexes en pierre et des assemblages en bois.
Ce cours propose une réinterprétation de la Stéréotomie avec différents outils, une réflexion sur la géométrie, les processus de fabrication, les modes de représentation, de communication.
Dans la suite de l'enseignement de la Géométrie et du Dessin de première année, ce cours est une introduction à la modélisation paramétrique et à l'usage de moyens numériques pour la fabrication de composants architecturaux, en vue d'application pratique.
Les objectifs principaux de ce semestre sont :
Comprendre les dessins d'architecte, savoir choisir les modes de représentation adéquats, exécutés à la main, ou avec divers logiciels.
Savoir expliquer les principes géométriques utilisés.
Développer une réflexion sur la démarche, les étapes, allant du dessin à la réalisation dans un matériau choisi.
Modélisation et fabrication sont enseignées en lien avec l'un des matériaux privilégié de la tradition stéréotomique :
la pierre et les questions géométriques des étapes de taille.
En complément de la théorie, 4 orientations pratiques sont proposées (1/4 des étudiants par orientation, 1 choix par personne, selon modalités d'inscription au premier cours) :
Taille de pierre avec récupération d'anciens blocs de pierre / Dessin à la main / Modélisation / Taille de pierre traditionnelle, assemblage et variations géométriques.
Mur avec récupération de fragments de béton / Modélisation / Dessin à la main / Taille et assemblage de blocs hétéroclites selon logique choisie (inspiration murs en pierre sèche).
Transitions spatiales.
Étude à travers les muqarnas des transitions spatiales en architecture, analyse de leurs principes constructifs selon leur matériau (pierre, bois, plâtre) et création d'une chaîne associative pièce-famille-assemblage pour obtenir un modèle numérique paramétrique pour leur fabrication, qui soit en "tôle", pour réalisation de maquette en carton et/ou impression 3d.
Escaliers (hélices paramétriques), éléments réalisés en bois / Modélisation Topsolid / Dessin à la main / Famille et Assemblage, variations sur le thème.
Des visites du laboratoire CRCL et ses robots seront proposées.
L'enseignement transmet les fondements théoriques de l'histoire de l'art figuratif et introduit les techniques opératoires de la représentation.
L'objectif principal est d'intégrer la pratique des outils numériques dans la dimension intellectuelle de la discipline.
Réflexion théorique et approche pratique sont insparables de la mthode d'enseignement.
Ce résultat peut étre obtenu par une connaissance scientifique de l'histoire de l'art et, de maniére parallle et indissociable, par une pratique continue des outils de la figuration expressive.
Un travail théorique pralable sur le concept de vraisemblance, en relation avec les implications de la réalité virtuelle, fait l'objet de plusieurs cours théoriques.
Ceux-ci sont axés sur les questions fondamentales de la construction et de la composition classiques de l'image picturale.

This course is concentrated on the history of Western architecture during the so-called 'long Renaissance,' a period that spans between the 15th and the 19th centuries.
Architecture as Project Architects, Theories and Buildings during the 'Long Renaissance' Professor.
Pier Vittorio Aureli The aim of this course is to introduce students to Western architecture during a decisive and controversial period of its history:
the so-called 'long Renaissance.' The term 'long Renaissance' addresses a period that spans between the 15thÂ and the 19thÂ centuries.
This era, also referred to as 'Early Modern,' is traditionally divided into smaller historical periods such as Early Renaissance, High Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque, Late Baroque, and Neo-Classicism.
In this course we will follow Manfredo Tafuri's thesis -- supported by other historians such as Delio Cantimori, Denys Hay and Eugenio Garin -- that the Renaissance should be understood as a long historical cycleÂ that started in the 15thÂ century and reached the shores of the Industrial Revolution.Â Against the idealization of the Renaissance as 'golden age' this course will approach the long Renaissance as a complex and contradictory period profoundly intertwined with the rise of capitalism and colonialism.
Two issues characterize the long Renaissance:
the confrontation with the legacy of classical architecture and the emergence of the project as an activity that distinguishes the architect from the builder.
The discovery of classical architecture gave architects and patrons the possibility to use an authoritative language that could break through the customs of medieval builders.
The project, which had the possibility to design prior to building, not only empowered the architect's vision over the builders' know-how, but it also defined the intellectual space of architecture.
The architectural project became the core of architecture as a discipline, the realm in which architects could design specific buildings and cultivate their idea of architecture.
Another important factor that reinforced the idea of architecture as a project was the rise of architectural theory and its diffusion via printed books, which became widespread starting from the early 16thcentury.
Through a selection of relevant cases study -- buildings, urban projects, drawings and books -- the course analyzes the relationship between project and building, idea and construction.
Specific attention will be given to both the political and cultural circumstances within which architectural project were produced.
The goal of the course is the possibility to analyze specific architectural projects and situate them within their larger historical context.
The question posed by the course is to what extent a specific architectural project can shed light on an entire historical period.

This is a survey course on the history of architecture of the twentieth century.
In the twentieth century, radical social, political, economic, environmental, and technological shifts challenged existing social contracts--offering new potentials for exercising dominance as well as paths toward liberation.
These historical transformations were reified in--and shaped by--new spatial arrangements.
This course will chart a map of these transformations as they intersected with the production of the objects most specific to the discipline of architecture:
buildings.
Despite their material solidity, buildings are both things and ideas.
Therefore, to understand the radical shifts of the twentieth century, we will focus not only on buildings but also on the ways in which thinking about buildings changed.
In order to consider buildings as simultaneously concrete objects and conceptual constructs, the course will focus on the notion of typology.
Prevalent in architectural discourse since the late eighteenth century, typology and type often sought to reconcile the material particularity of buildings with broader conceptual, historical, and geographic forces.
Moreover, the idea of type often enabled the discipline of architecture to react to seismic historical shifts while maintaining a certain degree of professional, intellectual, and aesthetic autonomy.
Aiming to understand these transformations, this course will take changing and competing definitions of typology as a means to historicize architecture in relation to modernity in the twentieth century.
This course surveys a period marked by the emergence of numerous projects of world governance, the global effects of two world wars, the implementation of socialist and welfare programs at a national scale, the exponential acceleration of climate crisis, and the dismantling of colonial empires (though not always their legacies).
This focus will lead away from narratives based on the work of singular architects and will rather emphasize an understanding of architecture as a broad cultural practice.
Unsettling the familiarity of the term "modern architecture," every week we will revise the relationship between modernism and modernity by considering processes, geographies, and subjects often excluded from those categories.
Instead of simply incorporating hitherto excluded case studies into the modernist canon, the class will offer a critical history of the canon itself.
How did architecture partake in constructing and consolidating power differentials such as those based on race, gender, and class?
Similarly, we will address episodes of liberation, criticism, and resistance associated with architecture throughout the twentieth century.
In contemporary times determined by rampant populism, acritical and techno-deterministic discourses, an ever-growing gulf of social inequality, and a severe ecological crisis, constructing a historical consciousness around the status of the built artifact is more important today than ever before.

Ce cours traite des divers domaines techniques intervenant dans la conception et la réalisation d'un bâtiment, soit:
physique du bâtiment, structures et matériaux, construction et installations techniques;
ceci dans une approche globale et transversale.
Le cours s'articule autour d'un exercice d'analyse approfondie d'un bâtiment d'école de la région Lausannoise qui permet de mettre en relation la théorie des 4 domaines du cours avec une réalité constructive et architecturale.
A l'aide de dossiers d'exécution, de visites sur place et de contacts avec les planificateurs, il s'agit:- de comprendre le fonctionnement, les critères de choix et la mise en œuvre des systèmes constructifs ;- de vérifier certaines performances par des calculs simples ou par simulation ;- de restituer et d'expliquer les parties analysées par des graphiques et des dessins ;- de formuler une critique de l'objet analysé.
Cette analyse est accompagnée de cours traitant de méthodologies et d'aspects théoriques en relation avec les thématiques d'analyse.
1) Physique du bâtiment (1/5) 2) Structures et matériaux (2/5) 3) Construction (1/5) 4) Installations (1/5)
Le cours a pour but de fournir aux étudiants les outils nécessaires pour lire et comprendre la ville et le territoire contemporain.
Le cours s'occupe de la ville et du territoire, de leur lecture et de leur interprétation.
Pour cela, il explore la Ville-territoire contemporaine et propose l'enseignement de l'analyse urbaine et territoriale, en articulant "quatre regards" différents.
Le premier regard implique une relation directe, physique, avec l'espace urbain et territorial.
C'est un regard rapproché, lié à l'expérience des lieux, il rentre dans la ville et le territoire, en observe les espaces, les personnes et les pratiques, en restituant une dimension socio-spatiale de l'analyse urbaine en utilisant des outils descriptifs tels que le relevé, l'écoute, l'analyse techniquement pertinente.
Certaines techniques comme la photographie et la vidéo pourront également être expérimentées.
Le deuxième regard est lié aux imaginaires et s'intéresse aux images qui construisent la mémoire collective et sociale des lieux ;
il interroge les préjugés, les images, les convictions partagées sur l'espace contemporain.
Au moyen d'analyses de la littérature, de la peinture, mais aussi des dynamiques sociales actuelles, ce regard cherche à déconstruire les lieux communs sur la ville contemporaine afin d'en exposer de nouvelles représentations qui en démultiplient la complexité.
Le troisième regard, celui du palimpseste, et cherche à regarder les traces qui ont construit l'histoire, celle de longue durée, des territoires et des villes, est un regard orienté à la lecture de l'espace urbain construit, des « trames urbaines », des « tissus », des espaces publics, à la lumière de leurs stratifications multiples.
Il s'agit d'un regard attentif aux analyses typo-morphologiques, aux transformations et à l'articulation des relations qui s'instaurent à l'intérieur de l'espace habité.
Ce regard s'appuie sur des cartes interprétatives, des cartes et analyses historiques (cadastre ancien, cartes nationales, photographies aériennes, IGN etc.), sur des coupes typo-morphologiques et des diagrammes.
Le dernier regard, le regard territorial, est orienté à l'observation des espaces ouverts, du paysage, des dynamiques naturelles et celles écologiques.
C'est un regard à travers lequel lire les grandes rationalités territoriales :
les systèmes des eaux, la topographie, les infrastructures de la mobilité.
Ce regard s'appuie, surtout, sur des cartes interprétatives à grande échelle, des coupes territoriales, les « transects », de conceptualisations et d'interprétations liées aux différents thèmes et à la littérature disponible.
À travers ces différents regards, tous à considérer comme nécessaires à égale mesure et complémentaires - et non pas alternatifs - le cours vise à fournir aux étudiants les outils pour comprendre l'espace contemporain, le dessiner et l'interpréter, comprendre ses contradictions et ses défis.
Tout.e.s les étudiants et étudiantes se familiariseront avec les outils d'analyse et les regards proposés en réalisant un "Carnet de Voyage" analysant leur espace de vie et ses transformations au cours des 30 dernières années.
Is it conceivable to question the very presence of highways in urban environments?
What potential for requalification does this space, with its unique characteristics, offer?
This is the central question that the Design Studio will explore, producing "counter-projects" aimed at overcoming, dismantling, adapting, repurposing, and reconceptualizing the highway barriers still present within the city.
Several Swiss cities are intersected by stretches of the national road network, remnants of a bygone era.
Today, these roads act as barriers to urban movement, sources of air and noise pollution, and spaces of congestion, as the massive traffic volumes they channel into the city are excessive.
The first step is to identify and map these areas;
the second is to develop hypotheses about their potential evolution.
Drawing on existing research, site visits, and project development, the Design Studio will generate ideas and perspectives to be debated collectively and publicly.
*** Celle-ci est l'interrogation que l'Atelier développera dans le semestre de printemps qui produira des « contre-projets » urbains de dépassement, démantèlement, adaptation, réutilisation, reconceptualisation des barreaux autoroutiers encore présents dans la ville.
Plusieurs villes suisses sont traversées par des tronçons du réseau des routes nationales helvétiques qui appartiennent à une époque dévolue :
ils agissent, aujourd'hui, comme des barrières aux mouvements de la ville, des pollueurs de l'air et acoustique, des espaces congestionnés car les grands volumes de trafic qu'ils amènent en ville est excessif.
Il s'agit d'abord de les repérer, de les cartographier et, deuxième, de développer des hypothèses de leur évolution.
A partir de recherches déjà développées, de visites des sites et de la construction de projets, l'Atelier fournira des idées et des points de vue à débattre collectivement et publiquement.
La maison comme une ville - Les grandes maisonnées continues.
Voyage d'étude - Zürich:
4 au 6 octobre 2025 LA MAISON COMME UNE VILLE LES GRANDES MAISONÉES CONTINUES DOMESTIC CITY-LAB (DC-LAB) STUDIO SOPHIE DELHAY assistée par Harry Waknine & Melchior Dechancé UNE THEME, L'HABITAT Constituant près de 80 % du grain de la ville, l'habitat est un levier décisif pour encourager les relations sociales, de soin, tout en réduisant nos besoins en ressources et en énergie, afin de faire évoluer la ville et le logement dans un même mouvement.
Travailler sur l'habitat, c'est trouver les formes pour rendre possible un monde plus juste d'un point de vue social, spatial, dans une écologie des rapports humains.
Le studio voit l'habitat comme le point de départ d'une architecture qui met au centre une vie intimement collective et solidaire, et qui explore des territoires à partir de leur caractère domestique.
Espaces et Usages:
L'habitat rend compte de dimensions spatiales, sociales et environnementales.
Ses dimensions spatiales sont proprement liées à la discipline architecturale (à la composition de plan, aux qualités constructives, matérielles, atmosphériques) ;
ses dimensions sociales sont liées aux modes de vie et aux usages ;
ses dimensions environnementales sont liées à ses besoins d'économie d'espace, de moyens, de matière et d'énergie.
Nous pensons l'habitat comme un principe émancipatoire capable, à l'aune des crises sociales et climatiques qui nous traversent, de révolutionner nos villes depuis l'intérieur.
L'habitat est un outil puissant pour concevoir une ville et une société plus justes, plus durables, vertueuses et hédonistes.
Territoires intimes:
Le studio situe l'habitat dans un spectre plus vaste que celui du logement.
L'habitat est un espace tendu entre la petite et la grande échelle :
entre le mobilier et le territoire, l'échelle domestique et l'échelle urbaine, le corps et la ville, le temps court des gestes quotidiens et le temps long des vies qui s'y succèdent.
L'habitat est aussi le lieu où s'entremêlent des usages ordinaires et extraordinaires, des aspects fonctionnels et poétiques, des habitudes et des surprises.
L'habitat est donc à la fois rationnel et poétique, concret et abstrait, immanent et ontologique, fondé sur notre capacité à se projeter, à rêver demain, et à être fondés par notre mémoire et nos désirs.
En bref, l'habitat établit avant tout des rapports, des articulations, et met en perspective des opposés, des notions a priori contradictoires ou habituellement dissociées.
L'habitat est le lieu du lien.
UN OUTIL, LA CUISINE La cuisine est prise comme point de départ des deux semestres.
Tout comme l'architecture, la cuisine est à la fois un espace (une pièce), un usage (le repas), un temps (un rituel), mais aussi un besoin vital (où l'on pourvoit à la subsistance) et un fait culturel (la gastronomie).
C'est aussi une discipline vernaculaire et exploratoire - locale et globale - entre cuisine traditionnelle et nouvelle cuisine.
Nous proposons d'interpréter et d'analyser l'espace de la cuisine sous quatre angles :
- En tant qu'espace social :
lieu où se déroule la commensalité, mais aussi espace approprié par ses habitants à travers la pratique incarnée de la préparation du repas.
- En tant qu'espace politique, révélateur des relations de pouvoir liées au travail productif et reproductif.
Il est aussi l'espace du logement le plus genré.
- En tant qu'espace hédoniste, où la gastronomie et la technique s'allient pour que la subsistance se transforme en plaisir partagé.
- En tant qu'espace climatique, équipé d'une alimentation en eau, d'appareils de cuisson, de réfrigérateurs et d'extracteurs d'air, elle pourrait jouer un rôle important dans le bien-être climatique de l'habitation, comme c'était le cas avant l'ère industrielle.
Pour toutes ces raisons, la cuisine est un outil puissant pour transformer politiquement, socialement et climatiquement la production standardisée de l'habitat.
La cuisine est aussi le lieu des sens et des plaisirs, et peut stimuler une architecture plus hédoniste.
1 RECHERCHE, 2 SEMESTRES Nous vous proposons d'explorer deux scénarios où les distinctions entre intérieur et extérieur, petite dimension et grande dimension, habituellement dévolues d'un côté au logement, de l'autre à la ville, seraient recomposées différemment.
Il s'agirait ici d'une même chose :
l'habitat.
Dans cet esprit, on vivrait la maison comme une ville et la ville comme une maison.
LA MAISON COMME UNE VILLE LES GRANDES MAISONÉES CONTINUES Ce semestre d'automne, le studio s'attachera à l'exploration de la typologie de la nappe, c'est-à-dire au logement de faible hauteur mais de haute densité.
Les ressorts de cette typologie n'ont été que peu exploités par le passé.
Le studio part du postulat que la transformation d'ouvrages étals (tels que des hangars ou des usines) en nappe permettrait l'essor d'une typologie qui associe de manière intense les deux caractères ambivalents de l'habitat:
vivre seul et ensemble, c'est-à-dire individuellement et collectivement.
D'un côté, la nappe promet un habitat dont les qualités mêlent indépendance, générosité des espaces extérieurs et variété typologique, et nous rechercherons comment ses multiples mitoyennetés peuvent, au contraire, favoriser des continuités et rendre possible une vie sociale plus collective et plus intense.
C'est ce que nous appellerons les grandes maisonnées continues.
De l'autre, cette typologie trouve en construction neuve ses limites en termes de faible compacité, développement proliférant et forte emprise au sol, qui en font un type dispendieux d'un point de vue écologique.
Nous rechercherons comment la typologie de la nappe, dans le cadre de la transformation, peut répondre à cet enjeu.
Dans l'ensemble, nous rechercherons comment les grandes maisonnées continues permettent d'établir une écologie des rapports humains.
Cuisines:
Le semestre débute par l'analyse d'un corpus de références de cuisines issues d'horizons géographiques et d'époques variés.
Ces analyses mettent en lumière la capacité de cette pièce à créer du lien entre habitant·e·x·s ou à réguler les climats dans l'espace domestique.
Des projets en transformation:
Concrètement, il s'agira de concevoir, par groupes de trois, une grande maisonnée (soit une nappe abritant plus de 100 personnes) continue en réutilisant un hangar existant à Lausanne.
Souvent destinés à être démolis et remplacés par des modèles de logements standardisés, les hangars nous offrent de nouvelles opportunités spatiales et domestiques.
À travers leur épaisseur typologique, leur générosité et répétitivité structurelle, leur transformation en grandes maisonnées continues stimule une conception de l'habitat qui s'éloigne des standards désormais révolus.
Des modes de vie contemporains:
Face aux bouleversements du foyer contemporain, les grandes maisonnées continues proposeront de nouvelles formes d'hospitalité pour faire coexister toutes les générations.
Les cuisines tisseront les liens entre habitant·e·x·s et organiseront la manière dont les ressources sociales et climatiques sont collectivement gérées et partagées.
Greenhouse Studies explore le potentiel des structures de serres dans le contexte des défis contemporains.
Les ateliers de projet étudient les serres comme un type architectural sensible au climat, capable de transformer des structures existantes en espaces collectifs et communautaires.
GREENHOUSE STUDIES II 'Clothing as an extension of our skin helps to store and to channel energy, ...If clothing is an extension of our private skins to store and channel our own heat and energy, housing is a collective means of achieving the same end for the family or the group.
Housing as shelter is an extension of our bodily heat-control mechanisms - a collective skin or garment.' Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media:
The Extensions of Man (Cambridge:
MIT Press, 1911) Following a first design studio on greenhouses, Laboratory EAST presents Greenhouse Studies II - The collective (Fall semester), and Greenhouse studies III - The common (Spring semester), the laboratory's second and third interaction with a unique element in the history of architecture.
The studio is interested in the multiple uses of greenhouse spaces outside the horticultural context.
In Greenhouse Studies I, the design studio took a cross-sectional look at domestic greenhouses as a space for expanding the individual home.
The greenhouse served as garden for vegetables, as passive heating device, or extra living room.
Through superposition, juxtaposition, or all-over solutions, the greenhouse spatial structure constituted a new thermal buffer zone that interacted differently with the existing volumes.
In Greenhouse Studies II and III, the studio will continue the survey, aware of new dimensions:
from the individual to the collective, from the collective to the common, from the small villa scale to the collective housing, from collective housing to common programs.
Together we will build on these concepts while exploring greenhouse-like solutions.
What are the implications of such change?
The results will contribute to an open-source, collaborative database that will grow each semester.
Type and Typology as framework Typology is recognised as a fundamental concept for a better understanding of architecture and its history.
It serves as a basic framework, a kind of tacit backbone for the organisation of architectural knowledge and can also be a tool for generating new architectural solutions.
Some argue that typology is as old as architecture itself, as it involves the reproduction of dominant types and models that are deeply rooted in socio-cultural realities.
Alternatively, it can be said that architecture responds to new social and economic needs by inventing or revising existing types.
Typology and types traditionally interact with the formal dimension (buildings organised by a common form or element) and the functional dimension (buildings organised by a common function).
However, this focus has often overlooked other, less tangible possibilities, such as structural relationships between types and climate in architecture.
Climatic Type as central theme Conservatories, greenhouses, glasshouses, forcing houses, hothouses, invernaderos in Spanish, orangeries, jardins d' hiver or serres in French - many are the terms associated with the idea of housing plants.
All of these artefacts have a common goal:
to create a climate adapted to plant life.
Although greenhouses were conceived with a very precise objective, this climatic space quickly became an exhibition space, a social space, and even a space for celebrations before it fell into disuse.
In the second half of the 20th century, greenhouse-based solutions made a comeback, fostering solar architecture and reinforcing the foundations of bioclimatic architecture in western societies.
During this time, horticulture continued developing greenhouses as productive spaces, and innovations led to intensive fields of production.
In absolute terms, it is not the form or function that characterizes the greenhouse but the definition of a space with specific climatic conditions.
In most cases, using wood or metal structures and transparent materials such as glass, these structures keep a very low ratio between the material used and the enclosed space, offering the most with the least.
The characterization of the greenhouse as an artefact of a climatic nature suggests that the greenhouse as a type does not depend on scale or size.
Since its inception, the multiform and multifunctional greenhouse space has been transformed into a social space with very specific microclimatic characteristics.
The collective 'The luxury of unused space!
This was also an attempt to test an idea.
The space changes independently.
Rooms change in space through the growing and dying of plants.
It should be attractive for the interior designer to experience such autonomous spatial changes.' In LOG ID (ed.), Gruene Archen-Harmonie mit Pflanzen leben das Modell der Gruppe LOG ID (Frankfurt am Main:
Fricke Verlag, 1983) Unfolding over the course of two semesters, both design studios will explore the dynamics between greenhouses, greenhouse components or greenhouse functions and existing building structures as architectural forms, climatic spaces and temporary uses of space:
Greenhouse Studies II The collective, the design studio will focus on the renovation of collective residential architecture in the Romandie.
When renovating existing monotonous buildings from the construction boom of the 1970s, the potential for conversion is overlaid with the climate aspect of the greenhouse.
The goal is to renovate the building, enhance its existing features, explore scenarios of densification, expand existing programmes or introduce new ones, enrich living comfort, and consider passive heating and cooling solutions.
The design should prioritise the collective dimension, and wherever possible, test greenhouse-like solutions by focusing on concepts such as seasonal living, microclimatic diversity, and synergy of living spaces.
Extending the building's lifespan involves considering materials, as well as exploring typological structures capable of accommodating change and a range of use cases.
The development of both phases will be undertaken in groups consisting of two or three students, and a Seminar Day will comprise a series of multidisciplinary theoretical contributions from external experts.
We will investigate the possible interactions between two different architectural spaces, and gain a better understanding of the typological transfers and climatic synergies between them.
Greenhouse-like structures offer the opportunity to investigate prefabricated systems, test designs for deconstruction and reversibility in design thinking, and ultimately find a 'lighter' way to redesign existing buildings.
By looking at greenhouses as specific built environments, the studio will formulate solutions based on the concept of architecture as atmosphere, while exploring its transformative potential.
In addition, the studio will examine greenhouses as climate-responsive artefacts, exploring how seasons can change spaces, or, in other words, what it means to inhabit spaces seasonally.
If we change clothes according to the seasons, should our buildings change too?
Practicalities Each semester will be composed of two parts.
The first part - Research on precedents - will be developed individually to expand the corpus of references and help us learn from existing buildings.
The studio will collectively build a visual atlas made of peculiar, strange or remarkable case-studies.
The design study will analyse the characteristics of the case studies, like:
flexible use of space, evaluate their thermal behaviour throughout the seasons, formmaking aspects, thermical airflow and mechanics of openings.
The key findings from this body of references will inform the design phase.
In the second part - Design Studio - participants will develop their own design in groups of two or three.
Learning outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to:
Apply and present research capable to inform a design project Analyse and interpret critically an architectural work Formulate a problem and provide design-based solution Represent accurately a design proposal with drawings and models at multiple scales Develop a narrative and present arguments to specialised and non-specialised audiences Develop awareness about the implicit and explicit messages of an architectural project Work collaboratively and integrate knowledge from different disciplines
"To be useful, helpful, of assistance to someone:" The "In Service of:
Berre" studio reflects on the architectural and territorial project as a form of public service.
It explores how architecture and design tools can engage in spatial struggles in the context of toxic, petrochemical territories.

Course Description:
Nota Bene:
This studio is part of the 'In Service of:...' fall series that seeks to redress uneven access to design and planning literacy for the majority (Previous studios:
'In Service of:
Marseille'--architectural, 'In Service of:
le Mirail'--urban, and this one, terrorial).
The studio series places design as a tool at the service of a place, a population, a territory, a narrative, for the benefit of the common good.
In Service of:
Berre "When crude oil enters our bodies in the form of toxins, it transforms our senses, creating a radically shifted orientation toward the world." Mameni, Salar.
Terracene:
A Crude Aesthetics.
Durham:
Duke University Press Durham, 2023.
The Etang de Berre (hereafter "Berre," the "Pond") is a 155 km brackish water bodya mix of sweet and salt water--surrounded by petrochemical industry.
The area of the largest saltwater lake in Europe is heavily polluted--as the water, air, soil, and bodies.
Located northwest of Marseille, the Etang de Berre is, since 1863, connected to the Mediterranean Sea by the Caronte canal, and since 1925, to the Port Autonome de Marseille via the Rove river tunnel.
In 1928, the oil company, Shell, installed a refinery in the village of Berre-l'etang, followed by two others in Lavera and La Mede.
Post-1945, more chemical and petrochemical plants were established.
An EDF hydroelectric power station was built in Saint-Chamas in 1966, using water from the Durance River through the Canal de Provence, and rejecting hot water since.
Since 1922, Marignane has been an aviation center, now home to Marseille's airport and many aircraft manufacturing facilities.
With the petro-hub of Fos-sur-Mer, established between 1962 and 1968, as the departure point of the South European crude oil pipeline feeding Crissier (Switzerland) and running up to Karlsruhe (Germany), the Etang de Berre/Gulf of Fos forms an indirect territory of extraction, of production, of processing, and consumption--in particular, of crude oil.
Distanced from extractive sites, the Berre area completes the picture of an aggregated 'Terracene' territory.
The term "Terracene," articulated by Salar Mameni, narrows down the scientific notion of the Anthropocene to focus specifically on environmental destruction.
This is particularly apt as developments around the Etang de Berre/Fos involve all sorts of discharges (chemical and hydrocarbon, energy-based, and domestic waste from the Marseille metropolitan area), resulting in multi-faceted, multi-temporal pollution.
Pollution is one of the expected consequences of material extraction, and oil pollution is just one of many issues related to technology, energy and modernity.
In the French context, environmental burdens are marked by environmental classism and lesser so, by environmental racism--working-class and migrant communities on peripheral territories bear disproportionate toxic loads from energy infrastructure that powers urban centers and national industrial production.
The communities surrounding the pond of Berre experience the environmental costs of France's and Europe's energy modernization--but there is resistance.
What does it mean to be in service of a toxic territory?
Rather than approaching the Etang de Berre as a site requiring a hypothetic "remediation," we investigate how design practices might work with the active toxicity of the territory and its derivatives' material intelligence while centering the voices and needs of affected communities--humans and more-than-humans.
We will build on previous works, notably by Bureau des Guides-13.
Architecture is one scale of toxicity--from homes constructed on polluted lands, housing proximity to industrial emissions, and domestic spaces becoming sites of bodily contamination.
Crucially, architecture is not merely a victim of toxicity but an active participant in toxic production.
The making of architecture is fundamentally reliant on oil, from concrete additives and steel production to plastic components, insulation materials, paints, sealants, and transportation of materials.
The petrochemical industry produces the very substances that constitute contemporary building:
synthetic polymers, adhesives, waterproofing membranes, and composite materials to name a few.
Thus every architectural project participates in oil's supply chains and contributes to these toxic landscapes of extraction and processing.
This studio challenges conventional approaches to design by engaging with Mameni's concept of petrorefusal as a way to think about pollution as another form of matter.
We examine how pollution--petrochemical substances and others--transforms landscapes, bodies, and communities, while acknowledging the agency of both human and more-than-human actors in these territories.
As a design studio, we approach contaminated territories as complex material conditions that require and foster different design methodologies--how do we design architectural and spatial strategies and tactics with and through toxicity?
Following Mameni's critique, we challenge the Anthropocene's "crude scientific generalization that cannot imagine--and more importantly refuses to see--other ways of being human." (1) The Etang de Berre exemplifies how environmental destruction is not a new epoch but an ongoing reality for territories bearing the ecological costs of industrial modernity.
Homes, schools, and workplaces near the petrochemical and industrial facilities experience elevated levels of toxic exposure through water, air, soil, food, building materials, and chemical intrusion.
Site & Trip The Etang de Berre is selected as the setting for this "In Service of:
..." studio because of its position as a paradigmatic toxic territory where environmental classism, industrial heritage, and community resistance intersect.
This landscape embodies the contradictions of France's energy modernization--providing the materials for urban prosperity while concentrating environmental burdens in peripheral working-class communities.
A 4-day excursion will take us on-site to the Etang de Berre region.
NB:
This trip will involve significant hiking and walking.
If you have specific requirements, accessibility needs, or health concerns, please contact us in advance so we can do our best to accommodate you.
Scales This studio is based on a conception of urban design as a multidimensional trans-scalar discipline.
Political, economic, social, cultural, and geo-tectonic forces affect and shape the built environment at the global scale, at the territorial and landscape scale, at the neighborhood and urban scale, down to the architectural and material scaleand to the body.
Space and its arrangements have a reciprocating effect on these forces, humans, and non-humans acting upon them.
We will design within these gradations, positing that each constituent scale is distinct and can be considered on its own, yet the piece as a whole is only complete with each scale, resulting in the sum of all the small scales producing a large-scale total.
In toxic territories, these scales become particularly crucial:
molecular contamination scales up to bodily exposure, soil infiltration, neighborhood pollution patterns, territorial supply chains, and global extraction networks.
We will also think around temporal scales to challenge "impatient capital" as it dictates architectural, urban, and landscape projects for immediacy, exploring seemingly contradictory notions of ephemeral and impermanent, durable, and longevity as frameworks for operation--particularly relevant when considering the deep time of toxic persistence and the urgency of environmental health.
End Notes Salar Mameni, Terracene:
A Crude Aesthetics (Durham:
Duke University Press, 2023).
L'atelier consiste en une mise en situation de projet dans l'existant, à a fois concrète et prospective.
Celle-ci s'étend du diagnostic à la réhabilitation, en passant par la reprogrammation.
La halle Tapponnier, construite à Annemasse en 1929 selon un procédé Hennebique, est notre objet d'étude.
Le déjà-là La halle Tapponnier a été construite en 1929 à destination d'un quai à marchandises en gare d'Annemasse.
L'entreprise Hennebique en a été chargée de la conception.
Fondée par François B.
Hennebique (1842-1921), l'entreprise est pionnière dans la généralisation progressive du recours au béton armé dans la construction, d'abord d'ouvrages d'art puis d'immeubles d'habitation, au tournant du XXe siècle.
C'est donc tout naturellement que la halle Tapponnier a été construite exclusivement en béton armé.
Les fermes de sa charpente, caractéristiques du procédé Hennebique, permettent de dégager ses plus de 1.000 m² de tout élément porteur à l'intérieur.
Particulièrement performante au regard de son usage initial, au profit des transports Tapponnier (auxquels elle doit son nom mais aujourd'hui disparus), la halle Tapponnier peine, depuis la fin du XXe siècle, à s'adapter à un nouvel usage.
De fait, malgré le caractère remarquable de son architecture, l'intérêt de son emplacement et l'ampleur de son volume capable, en l'absence de projet de réactivation, son état se détériore et mène à sa ruine progressive.
Une situation urbaine complexe Dès l'origine, la halle Tapponnier participe d'une situation urbaine particulièrement riche autour des voies de chemin de fer qui traversent et desservent la Ville d'Annemasse.
Composé de la halle, d'une gare (construite par Maurice Braillard, arch., en 1932 ;
aujourd'hui largement remaniée) et d'une imposante rotonde ferroviaire (aujourd'hui démolie), ce site est aujourd'hui difficilement lisible dans sa configuration historique.
Il a en effet connu de nombreuses évolutions tout au long du XXe siècle et en ce premier quart du XXIe siècle, en parallèle du développement exponentiel de la ligne Annemasse-Genève.
La dernière en date (2017-2020) a notamment vu la création d'un bâtiment voyageurs, intégrant littéralement la gare historique et jouxtant la halle Tapponnier.
Plus largement, l'ensemble du quartier de la gare est aujourd'hui fondu dans le projet de l'« écoquartier de l'Étoile ».
La réhabilitation de la halle Tapponnier, bien qu'intégrée au périmètre de cet aménagement, ainsi que celle du terrain vague la prolongeant, n'est toujours pas entamée.
Le potentiel du patrimoine La mise au jour du potentiel d'un bâti existant, qu'il soit protégé ou ordinaire, implique son étude préalable.
À travers celle de la halle Tapponnier, il s'agit de s'approprier les méthodes et les outils spécifiques de l'étude patrimoniale.
Leur maîtrise, à laquelle tend à initier cette première séquence, participe d'une meilleure compréhension de ce qui est déjà là, en vue d'une intervention.
Il s'agit également de prendre conscience que cette étude constitue une part intégrante du projet et pas seulement une phase liminaire, dépourvue d'intentions conceptuelles.
L'étude patrimoniale intègre le relevé de l'existant sur site, son étude historique et sa critique d'authenticité à partir des archives ainsi que son diagnostic technique et sanitaire.
La mener à bien suppose d'adopter une démarche pluridisciplinaire en impliquant des spécialistes tels que des ingénieurs, des entreprises et des chercheurs.
Cette phase d'étude constitue également une opportunité de s'interroger sur les modes de représentation de l'architecture et du paysage.
Par ailleurs, il est important de rappeler que l'ensemble de ces méthodes et outils ne constitue pas seulement un corpus figé de procédés expérimentés mais bien un champ de recherche contemporain, expérimental et continu.
Restaurer, transformer, créer Seule une réactivation par l'usage peut assurer la pérennité de l'existant et en l'occurrence celle de la halle Tapponnier.
La reprogrammation constitue à ce titre une phase de réflexion préalable et indispensable à la réhabilitation.
Viennent ensuite les différents types d'intervention dans l'existant, de la restauration à la création, en passant par la transformation.
Ces derniers ne doivent pas être déterminés a priori mais résulter des conclusions de l'étude patrimoniale, en particulier de celles relatives à la valeur patrimoniale des éléments constitutifs de la halle Tapponnier.
Le potentiel de celle-ci ne se révèlera concrètement qu'à travers ces interventions.
Pour servir au présent, l'existant peut ainsi nécessiter une restauration, totale ou partielle, impliquer une transformation d'une de ses parties, voire exiger une création, sous la forme d'une extension par exemple.
De plus, au-delà du type d'intervention, se pose la question du parti pris.
En effet, chacun de ces types se décline pour participer au mieux à un projet cohérent.
Ces interventions doivent être contextualisées (c'est-à-dire définies par rapport au site, aux matériaux, aux mises en œuvre, etc.) et inscrites parmi celles de nombreux partenaires (ingénieurs et entreprises spécialisés).
Bioclimatisme et enjeux contemporains L'intervention dans l'existant est une pratique ancienne bien que résolument contemporaine, en phase avec les enjeux écologiques et sociaux d'aujourd'hui.
L'obsolescence fonctionnelle de la halle Tapponnier constitue, à ce titre, un cas d'école.
Elle attire notre attention sur la capacité d'adaptation de ce qui est déjà là et de ce que nous construisons.
Cette adaptabilité s'entend bien sûr sur le plan des usages mais également sur ceux de l'environnement et du confort, notamment face au dérèglement climatique.
Ainsi, la réactivation de cette halle en béton nécessite de l'appréhender au prisme d'une conception bioclimatique.
En phase d'étude, cela signifie d'en identifier les faiblesses thermiques, hygrométriques et acoustiques mais aussi les potentialités d'éclairage et de ventilation naturels.
En phase de projet, il ne s'agit donc pas de mettre en œuvre des solutions ex nihilo mais davantage d'optimiser l'isolation, de valoriser les apports solaires ou encore d'améliorer la ventilation naturelle.
Pour ce faire et poursuivre un objectif d'une moindre empreinte carbone, on peut privilégier le recours à la végétation, l'utilisation de matériaux biosourcés ou encore le remploi de matériaux.
Loin de nous décourager, ces enjeux doivent donc nous responsabiliser et nous pousser à agir en nous saisissant, par exemple, du patrimoine comme d'une ressource et un point d'appui générateur de projet.
Typological Urbanism bridges architecture and urbanism through dual perspectives:
architectural typologies shaping urban form from within, and urban types shaping it from without.
Working across scales, the studio explores evolving Swiss urban contexts through ensemble and composite forms.
Architecture versus Urbanism The term Typological Urbanism refers to a design method situated at the overlap of architecture and urbanism.
In our understanding, urbanism is neither the outcome of engineered masterplans - where form is determined and filled with program - nor the product of a loose collection of autonomous architectural objects.
Instead, we believe in a strong interdependency between architecture and urbanism.
We recognize a conceptual gap in practice between these two disciplines.
Typological Urbanism allows us to respond with precision to the multiple dimensions of the urban condition - context, program, and existing fabric - without relying on idealistic projections.
Instead, it operates through inherent rules:
robust yet flexible enough to be reassembled in every moment.
This assemblage relies in a fluent state, like the work of Imi Knoebel it can feel assembled and disassembled at the same time.
This ambiguity and open-endedness enable appropriation and identification.
A Dual Approach Typological Urbanism can be approached from two complementary directions:
From within:
architectural typologies (such as housing) generate spatial organization and in turn shape urban form.
From without:
predefined or emergent urban types constitute our built environment, including aspects such as open space, program, ownership, and accessibility.
This duality reflects the legacy of modernist thought - its search for rationality - and its postmodern revision, which reintroduced context, memory, and multiplicity into design.
Synthesizing these principles enables us to resist both dogmatism and nostalgia.
Working Across Scales This duality is not contradictory;
on the contrary, it becomes our design method.
To investigate it, we will work simultaneously on two scales:
the individual unit and the urban figure.
By studying how these two levels interact, we aim to reveal deeper spatial relationships.
Our starting point will be specific housing typologies, through which we will analyse spatial logics and organizational principles.
From there, we will scale outward - investigating how abstract volumes relate to one another within a larger spatial composition.
The central question becomes:
can the relationships and conditions identified at the architectural scale be translated into, or discovered within, the urban dimension?
Sites of Urban Reassembly In the Swiss context, urban development is no longer driven by expansion into open land, but by the densification and transformation of existing environments.
Within these already-defined boundaries, most areas transitioning from industrial or infrastructural uses to residential, commercial, services or public functions have now been developed.
Yet some questions remain.
Our investigations extend beyond these specific zones and apply equally to the mixed-use city, to urban areas growing across municipal lines, to agglomerations evolving into coherent urban forms, and to housing settlements striving for greater density and urban character.
Urban Ensemble or Urban Composite Over the course of the academic year, each semester will prioritize one aspect of this duality within a design project:
Semester 1:
The Urban Ensemble (Zurich):
Focused on how urban form emerges from the interaction of typologies in a loose arrangement of buildings.
Semester 2:
The Urban Composite (Lausanne):
Investigates the idea of a hybrid building - a type in itself that incorporates multiple typologies.
Challenging outdated zoning laws, we will apply a consistent programmatic set in each context - a mix of uses tailored to local conditions, yet designed to ensure that a piece of city can emerge and evolve.

It's about space!
The spaces are small, following one another in rapid sequences, shifting direction, light, views, form, furniture, and use.
This is living.
A rich spatial experience that goes far beyond fulfilling functional requirements and measurable parameters.
Over the course of two semesters, we explore the spatial potential of housing on an individual site.
The goal is to create generous and versatile spaces within a small area.
A way to respond to limited resources through spatial strategies.
We experiment with parametric tools to transform familiar rooms and apartments, explore variations, refine spatial relationships, discover geometric possibilities, and define architectural principles.
Simultaneously we are using analog spatial techniques, to analyse, develop, and present the projects.

The course explores how minimal architectural interventions can have a lasting impact through sensitivity to context, community, and place.
Using Aurigeno in Valle Maggia as a case study, students develop proposals rooted in observation, care, and territorial acupuncture.
How can architecture have an impact without being imposing?
Through precise observation, careful approach, and a profound engagement with each specific place, it becomes possible to create architectonical gestures that are reduced to the absolute essentials.
It is about the smallest possible intervention - stripped down to its essence - that conserves resources yet remains powerful.
Such an approach responds to the site itself, to its existing traces and potentials, and to the needs of its inhabitants.
This requires close attention and listening, as well as an understanding of the context as a built reality, in all its spatial, social, and cultural facets.
At the core lies an attitude of care:
only those who engage intensively with the local conditions and the needs of the inhabitants can develop interventions that achieve broad social acceptance and endure over time.
Such an approach can strengthen the resilience of a place.
When future users see themselves reflected in the built environment, when the architectural intervention embeds itself in the layers of collective memory, architecture becomes part of the common ground.
This generates care - concern, responsibility, and identification - from the inhabitants, who embrace the new addition, which in turn contributes to the project's longevity.
Thus, the much-discussed notion of sustainability in architecture today is not only ecological, material, or economic;
it must also address the social and cultural rootedness of the intervention within its context.
It questions how architects can listen attentively and plan with precision projects that achieve great impact through territorial acupuncture.
This semester, we will focus on the village of Aurigeno in the Valle Maggia in Ticino.
It is a picturesque village facing the same challenges as many others:
a shrinking and aging population.
Consequently, public space, as an extension of the domestic sphere, becomes an even more crucial setting for social interaction.
We will engage deeply with Aurigeno - its residents, its history, its built fabric - in order to imagine together where these interactions could take place.
At the same time, we will analyze the broader territorial scale and observe the smallest given details.
We will investigate where potential for encounters already exists - often as missed opportunities - which we can reinterpret and transform into shared spaces that foster social exchange through territorial acupuncture.
During the semester, a lecture series featuring experts from various disciplines will offer diverse perspectives on the role of public space across time, society, and spatial coexistence.
The studio in the fall semester will be primarily led by Rina Rolli, with the assistance of Blerta Axhija.
Successional Dwellings:
An experimental semester, based on the concept of 'succession'.
Building and inhabiting as a continuous process, that never comes to an end.
SUCCESSIONAL DWELLINGS This is going to be an experimental semester, based on the concept of 'succession'.
Succession is an ecological term describing the sequence in which plant and animal communities replace one another over time at a given site.
We adopt this concept to re-imagine building and inhabiting as a form of succession:
every moment in a building's life hosts a particular community of inhabitants, only to be succeeded by others.
1 DisturbancesA successional sequence usually begins with a disturbance - wether storm, wildfire, clearance or sealing of the soil.
However devastating such damage may be, it also opens space for pioneer organisms and, in turn, for the many follow-on communities they invite.
In the studio we will build our houses on plots in Lausanne that have also been disturbed:
by rockfalls, landfilling or dioxin pollution.
Carefully studying these sites, with all their visible and invisible histories, will be an important first step for us.
2 PioneersDirectly afterwards we will start to build on those disturbed sites.
Just as pioneer plants put down roots in disturbed ground, we start with the foundations of a house, asking, for example, whether screw piles or rubble-stone footings can become part of a larger root system.
We test these questions in pairs at large working models that evolve throughout the semester.
3 Passing-onNow - after a few weeks in the studio - something unusual will happen:
we pass on our project to another group and receive a project in return.
Yes!
We as architects will become successors throughout the whole semester, several times.
That makes us aware that everything we create will be subject to change at some point in the future - but also that this is a joyful way of working collectively in the studio.
One might think this could be the end of authorship in architecture.
Actually, it is the opposite:
a condensation of multiple authorships, merged in constantly growing projects.
We will not have traditional crits or presentations.
Instead, we will hold four handovers, in which groups collectively hand over and take over.
4 StratificationBeing constantly passed around through the studio, our houses grow denser and denser.
Although always under construction, they are inhabited.
We record this simultaneous building and dwelling through photographs of our large models and additional drawings.
To capture all scales, we will combine 1:1 to 1:1,000 in a single model.
Daring!
Over time we learn which materials can grow along with the house and how to steer them in a gardener's manner.
We delight in wandering components and puzzle over invasive elements;
we test which materials can serve as a solid wall for one season before migrating to another part of the project.
5 RolesIf buildings are constantly evolving like organisms, the question arises as to who will take on these ongoing construction tasks.
Can those who live in the buildings also build walls, lay bricks and move doors themselves?
On a study trip to Leipzig (Germany), we will immerse ourselves in the world of self-build for a long weekend.
We will lend a hand in a non-profit building project and learn about guided self-build strategies that go beyond the cliche of DIY.
The practical experience will help us develop alternative forms of building and living for our studio projects.
6 ClearingMid-semester our houses reach a stage of maximum density and diversity.
Now we learn how important it is to thin, prune and clear - creating space for yet further communities and thus keeping the process of succession alive.
We discover the productive power of selective felling, so different from demolition or destruction.
7 CompostTowards the end of the semester we will increasingly work with the leftovers - the cuttings from our previous actions.
We try not to throw anything away, but to make it productive on the spot:
as new building materials for alternative forms of living.
We are delighted with those materials that can simply be reused or composted, and we also look for solutions for materials already in the world that we would prefer to see disappear because of their toxicity.
8 CollectionBy term's end we stand before large models that have passed through many successive states, gone through many hands, and been captured in series of images and drawings.
It is this evolving process - with all its interim conditions - that interests us far more than any final, fixed stage.
We will spend the last few weeks finishing the documentation of this process:
together, we will distil the most intriguing moments and insights from the previous phases and transformations.
We will record these in the form of a cross-project, illustrated glossary.
The final step will be a joint review of all successions.
9 Studio environmentThe studio is aimed at students who are open to experimental teaching and working formats.
Students generally work in groups of two.
However, each group also works with the other groups by passing on work stages several times during the semester.
Projects are rotated and developed by many students in successions - a continuous process of transformation.
Students should therefore have a particular interest in collaborative working methods.
A particular focus of teaching is on very practical, material-related construction techniques for experimental forms of living.
In the studio, we work with large models that show scales from 1:1 to 1:1,000.
The semester is accompanied by guest lectures from external contributors on topics such as process-oriented construction, self-build techniques and material cycles.

Le studio Weinand adopte une approche de conception axée sur l'expérimentation des matériaux et le prototypage, en se concentrant sur le bois, les herbes et la terre.
À l'IBOIS, une riche expérience guide l'exploration de prototypes reliant concepts architecturaux et réalité construite.
Du prototype au bâtiment L'IBOIS met l'accent sur des approches de conception guidées par les matériaux.
L'année dernière, ils ont introduit la Structure en plaques de bois à fixation intégrale (IATPS), qui relie directement la conception numérique au processus de fabrication.
Les technologies numériques ont transformé le rôle de l'architecte, désormais aussi celui d'un fabricant.
L'objectif est de trouver les usages optimaux pour des matériaux spécifiques et des comportements structurels précis.
Ces outils numériques réduisent également les coûts de communication tout au long du processus de conception.
Aujourd'hui, les prototypes offrent un moyen de communication efficace entre l'homme et la machine, et peuvent être produits à moindre coût grâce à la fabrication numérique.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'un prototype?
En architecture, un prototype est une maquette à l'échelle réelle ou réduite, utilisée pour tester, affiner et explorer un projet avant la construction.
Il comble l'écart entre les idées abstraites et leur mise en œuvre physique, en révélant les qualités spatiales, les performances matérielles, les méthodes de construction et l'interaction avec l'utilisateur.
Contrairement aux modèles virtuels, les prototypes physiques permettent un engagement direct et facilitent l'évaluation de la viabilité réelle d'un projet.
Les prototypes architecturaux ont toujours servi d'outils d'expérimentation - des modèles en plâtre complexes de Gaudí aux constructions à l'échelle 1:1 comme la Khudi Bari au Bangladesh.
Qu'ils soient utilisés pour répondre à des conditions environnementales, à des défis constructifs ou à des besoins communautaires, les prototypes permettent aux architectes de tester des concepts radicaux tout en minimisant les risques.
En particulier dans les contextes à faibles ressources, le prototypage associe crèativité et nécessité, aboutissant à des structures innovantes et adaptatives, ancrées dans des conditions réelles.
En s'appuyant sur les recherches passées en matière de prototypage et de matériaux, le Studio Weinand organise une série d'ateliers centrés sur la fabrication numérique, complétés par des visites de sites afin d'observer directement l'application des matériaux et les contextes constructifs.
Ces sessions relient les concepts de conception à leur réalisation physique en encourageant l'expérimentation à l'échelle réelle.
Ici, le prototypage n'est pas seulement une technique, mais un état d'esprit - qui redéfinit notre approche du processus constructif.
Travailler directement avec des matériaux bruts remet en question les méthodes linéaires conventionnelles de conception et incite à une réévaluation critique de l'ensemble de la chaîne de production et d'approvisionnement, avec pour objectif de réduire l'empreinte écologique de la construction en bois.
From Prototype to Building IBOIS emphasizes material-driven design approaches.
Last year, they introduced the Integrally-Attached Timber Plate Structure (IATPS), which connects digital design directly to the fabrication process.
Digital technologies have shifted the architect's role into that of a maker.
The goal is to find optimal uses for specific materials and structural behaviours.
These digital tools also lower communication costs across the design process.
Today, prototypes offer an efficient medium of communication between human and machine and can be produced affordably using digital fabrication.
So, what is a prototype?
In architecture, a prototype is a full-scale or scaled-down model used to test, refine, and explore a design before construction.
It closes the gap between abstract ideas and physical implementation, revealing spatial qualities, material performance, building methods, and user interaction.
Unlike virtual models, physical prototypes allow direct engagement and make it easier to assess a design's real-world viability.
Architectural prototypes have always served as tools for experimentation-from Gaudi's intricate plaster models to today's 1:1 construction like the Khudi Bari in Bangladesh.
Whether used to address environmental conditions, construction challenges, or community needs, prototypes allow architects to test radical concepts while minimizing risk.
Especially in low-resource settings, prototyping blends creativity with necessity, resulting in innovative, adaptive structures grounded in real-life conditions.
In this studio workshop, we focus on three material themes.
First, interlocking self-bearing watertight envelops from timber.
Second, interlocking self-bearing watertight envelops from grasses.
Third, actively bended interlaced timber grids with projected earth.
The timber project, led by IBOIS, involves stacked trunks and watertight joinery.
The grasses' theme explores how vernacular traditions use layered bundles to create water-resistant shelter, reimagined through digital tools.
Lastly, bending timber grids form curved structures.
When layered with earth, they improve thermal insulation and protect the timber.
We'll propose ways to build these structures using spraying techniques and digital methods.
Building on the foundation of past research into prototyping and materials, Studio Weinand organizes a series of workshops centred on digital fabrication, complemented by site visits to observe material application and construction contexts firsthand.
These sessions connect design concepts with physical realization by encouraging full-scale experimentation.
Here, prototyping is not just a technique but a mindset - one that redefines how we approach the construction process.
Working directly with raw materials challenges conventional linear design workflows and prompts a critical revaluation of the entire production and supply chain, with the goal of reducing the ecological footprint of timber construction.
Le design studio porte sur un centre pour les femmes situé à Wau, au Sud-Soudan.
Il s'inscrit dans la continuité des expériences précédentes menées au sein du laboratoire FAR et, notamment, dans un programme axé sur le thème de l'architecture dans le domaine de la coopération internationale.
Région affectée par une pauvreté chronique et une instabilité politique, l'Afrique subsaharienne est également exposée au changement climatique et à ses conséquences sociales et environnementales.
Le design studio donnera donc l'occasion de réfléchir sur la capacité des architectes à apporter des réponses face aux situations extrêmes et aux contextes isolés d'un point de vue social, environnemental et économique.
Le programme fonctionnel se compose d'une clinique ambulatoire axée sur la santé des femmes (préparation à la maternité, santé reproductive, violence fondée sur le genre) et de locaux destinés à activités de formation et d'éducation.
L'exercice s'inscrit dans un contexte réel et se veut centré sur la relation entre l'engagement éthique et les limites de l'instrumentation disciplinaire/professionnelle, dans des circonstances qui sont, par définition, étrangères et éloignées, non seulement géographiquement, de la réalité de l'étudiant-e.
L'étudiant-e est activement confronté-e à plusieurs questions, non seulement architecturales, au centre du debat actuel :
utilisation responsable des ressources, inclusion, impact du changement climatique, participation, relations transculturelles.
La relation étroite avec la réalité implique la nécessité de mesurer, littéralement, le projet en termes de faisabilité économique et de durabilité globale.
A region affected by chronic poverty and political instability, sub-Saharan Africa is also exposed to climate change and its social and environmental consequences.
The studio will thus be used as an opportunity to reflect on architects' ability to provide responses to extreme situations and remote contexts at social, environmental, and economic level.
The functional programme includes an outpatient clinic focusing on women's health (maternity preparation, reproductive health, gender-based violence) and training and education activities.
The exercise is placed in a real context and is intended as centred on the relationship between ethical commitment and the limits of disciplinary/professional instrumentation, in circumstances that are, by definition, foreign, and remote, not only geographically, from the student's reality.
The student is actively confronted with many of the issues central to the debate today, not only architectural:
responsible use of resources, inclusiveness, impact of climate change, participation, transcultural relations.
The close relationship with reality implies the need to measure, literally, the project in terms of economic feasibility and overall sustainability.
The studio examines the effects of artificial intelligence on architecture and cities.
Generative tools are approached as cultural and political instruments, shaping design through data grounded in territory, economy, identity, imagery, and ecology.
In the wake of rogue LLMs, autonomous agents, opaque algorithms, and AI slop, architectural tools are undergoing a profound reconfiguration.
Generative design workflows and computational surrogates offer immense modeling power but also contribute to homogenization, "slopification," and erosion of critical authorship.
This studio investigates how AI might "design for itself," aiming to reclaim agency through the design of data and computational infrastructure.
Rather than treating AI as a self-effacing technical container, we approach it as a social, civic, and ethical instrument, embedded in territorial, ecological, and architectural contexts.
We examine the Urban Transformer (UT) as a novel typology:
a possible architecture for responsible and integrated AI infrastructure, and an inevitable one, whether we like it or not.
These structures may take the form of transparent data farms, distributed urban brains, or sentient infrastructural nodes.
They can appear as cohesive or decentralized systems, embedded within existing urban and suburban fabrics or as isolated techno-enclaves.
The Urban Transformer becomes a test case for how architecture can shape, and be shaped by, the infrastructural needs of intelligence, balancing physical constraints with civic, ecological, and symbolic demands.
The goals of the studio are threefold:
(1) to critically explore the use of generative AI in architectural design, tracing its risks and potentials beyond aesthetic automation;
(2) to invent an Urban Transformer prototypology that counters the tendency toward isolated, opaque, extractive techno-capitalist systems;
(3) to articulate a new architectural process and language for intelligence where form is shaped as much by energy demands, cooling logic, and physical storage as by the need for commons, symbolic resonance, public trust, and data transparency.
As AI's societal role remains contested, this studio positions architectural design as a crucial arena for negotiating how flows of intelligence become spatial, and how such architectures can mediate between technology and humanity.
This intensive studio will employ advanced digital tools and generative AI for "vibecoding" architecture.
Experimental and remote LLMs and MCP agents will be introduced as exploratory digital modeling tools.
A range of software, scripts, and plugins for mapping and open geodata analysis (e.g., Rhino & Grasshopper, QGIS), along with GenAI tools for representation (such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E), may act as co-design agents throughout the studio's successive phases.
No prior programming or software knowledge is required, but curiosity and strong motivation to learn are essential.
Des communautés shakers aux USA à la question du logement à Bâle, le semestre interroge l'habitat comme lieu intime et collectif, en explorant la transformation des espaces de travail en nouveaux lieux de partage.
Kommune in Basel 2025 Hétérotopie Pour la seconde année consécutive, le studio TEXAS s'appuie sur le texte de la conférence que Michel Foucault a prononcée en 1967, Des espaces autres - Hétérotopies.
Ce texte s'inscrit dans le cadre général de la description, par Foucault, de divers systèmes de domination.
Plus précisément, il nous concerne directement en tant qu'architectes, car il décrit la manière dont « il y a, et ceci, dans toute société, des utopies qui ont un lieu précis et réel, un lieu qu'on peut situer sur une carte, des utopies qui ont un temps qu'on peut fixer et déterminer, un temps qu'on peut fixer et mesurer selon le calendrier de tous les jours.
» Foucault prétend donc qu'une organisation spatiale singulière permet de construire des utopies qui sont, au sens strict du terme, habituellement des lieux sans lieu.
Transformer des laboratoires en logements Ce semestre, nous inventerons de telles utopies à partir de la transformation d'un immeuble de laboratoires construit à Bâle, au bord du Rhin, par Suter et Suter en 1967, en logements.
Pour ce faire, nous prendrons un des espaces habituels du logement - la chambre parentale, la chambre des enfants, la salle de bains, la circulation, la salle à manger, etc.
- et nous le mutualiserons, le rendrons collectif, à l'échelle de l'ensemble du bâtiment.
Pour justifier cela, dans chaque cas, les étudiant·e·s auront à imaginer les modes de vie et les règles internes de la communauté.
Liselotte et O.
Ungers, Kommunen in der Neuen Welt 1740-1972 Pour stimuler et appuyer les réflexions, nous étudierons le livre de Liselotte et Oswald Mathias Ungers, Kommunen in der Neuen Welt 1740-1972, publié en 1972.
Le grand architecte et théoricien allemand et sa femme, sociologue, y décrivent la manière dont une série de communes, de communautés communistes, ont vu le jour aux USA du milieu du XVIIIe siècle au début des années 1970.
Motivées par des raisons politiques ou religieuses, ces communautés sont, par excellence, des hétérotopies, et mettent en évidence la manière dont organisation spatiale et sociale peuvent se définir mutuellement.
Le laboratoire TEXAS a produit une traduction française de l'ouvrage, disponible en allemand pour les étudiant·e·s.
The Shakers:
A World in the Making Pour expérimenter partiellement les espaces et objets d'une de ces communautés américaines, nous visiterons, à l'occasion de notre voyage d'étude qui se déroulera à Bâle du 13 au 15 septembre, l'exposition consacrée aux meubles shakers au Vitra Design Museum.
Les shakers sont une des communautés étudiées par le couple Ungers, et une des plus célèbres par ailleurs.
Soucieux de vivre dans une simplicité cohérente avec leur foi chrétienne, les shakers sont connus pour avoir développé des espaces et des objets qui entrent en résonance avec nos préoccupations contemporaines.« La beauté réside dans l'harmonie.
- L'ordre est le créateur de la beauté.
- La beauté repose sur l'utilité.
Toute beauté qui ne repose pas sur l'utilité devient rapidement insipide et doit être constamment remplacée.
» écrivaient-ils pour décrire les nombreuses règles qui régissaient leurs vies.Ce questionnement sur le rôle de l'utilité dans la définition de la beauté est, bien entendu, au cœur de tout projet d'architecture, cet art de la nécessité, et plus particulièrement d'un projet de logement, dans la mesure où il s'agit d'un des programmes qui réclament le plus de précision quant à l'usage et à la création d'un environnement agréable et significatif.
Steve McQueen, Bass Afin de prolonger la réflexion sur la manière de rendre compte des systèmes de domination, en lien avec le travail de Foucault, nous nous confronterons à la capacité d'un artiste à travailler sur des questions sociales et historiques telles que la mémoire de l'esclavage ou les grèves de la faim menées par les militants irlandais dans les années 1980 dans les geôles britanniques, en visitant l'exposition Bass de l'artiste britannique d'origine caribéenne Steve McQueen, qui a actuellement lieu au Schaulager, un des bâtiments les plus remarquables de Herzog & de Meuron.
Après la visite, nous assisterons à une discussion entre Steve McQueen et Christina Sharpe, professeure de littérature anglaise et d'études sur les Noirs à l'Université York de Toronto.
La forme véhicule des valeurs :
cette notion, au cœur de notre enseignement, trouvera ici un écho direct.
Dan Graham, Rock My Religion Afin de prolonger la réflexion sur les communautés communistes américaines et l'exposition sur les shakers, nous visionnerons, au cours des deux jours de séminaire de lancement du studio, les 8 et 9 septembre, le film Rock My Religion de l'artiste américain Dan Graham.
Aux confins de la sculpture, de l'architecture, de la culture pop et de la musique rock, Dan Graham a défini un champ de travail très spécifique, d'un intérêt majeur pour les architectes.
Dans ce film du début des années 1980, il propose l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'origine du rock et de sa dimension cathartique serait à rechercher dans les danses et les transes qui ont valu leur nom aux shakers.
Dans les temps troublés que nous vivons, la réflexion sur la transformation des bâtiments, d'une part, et la réflexion sur les modes d'organisation sociale et politique en lien avec l'organisation de l'espace, d'autre part, sont plus que jamais nécessaires.
C'est ce que nous explorerons cet automne, afin de continuer à comprendre dans quelles conditions la forme architecturale peut être émancipatrice plutôt que dominatrice, tout en étant, comme elle l'a toujours été, l'objet d'une discipline culturelle complexe qui met en œuvre, sur un pied d'égalité, valeurs mesurables et non mesurables.
L'atelier propose d'explorer le thème de la construction dans le territoire alpin, à la lumière des changements imposés par les transformations économiques et sociales qui s'opèrent ces dernières décennies.
Le programme prévoit de développer un lieu communautaire mêlant habitat et artisanat.
Le travail du semestre a pour objectif l'expérimentation ponctuelle d'une stratégie de recolonisation de la vallée de l'Intyamon dans la région de la Gruyère (Fribourg) par le développement d'activités cohérentes avec leur condition géographique spécifique.
En partant de l'opportunité offerte par la présence de lignes de chemin de fer, construites à l'époque pour le développement touristique et industriel, certaines régions alpines ont aujourd'hui l'occasion de redéfinir leur identité culturelle et productive indépendamment de la monoculture hôtelière ou extractive.
Dans ce contexte, l'atelier propose d'explorer le thème de la construction dans le territoire alpin à la lumière des changements imposés par les transformations économiques et sociales qui s'opèrent ces dernières décennies.
Le site pour cette année sera le village d'Albeuve, sur la ligne de train qui relie Montreux à Bulle.
L'objectif pragmatique est de s'appuyer sur l'infrastructure ferroviaire existante pour induire de nouvelles synergies et une densification de la vallée de l'Intyamon.
L'abandon de la monoculture touristique et de l'exploitation extractive est le postulat principal sur lequel se base le travail expérimental de l'atelier.
Le projet est envisagé parallèlement comme outil critique de lecture du territoire dans ses formes culturelles et matérielles, et comme dispositif pratique permettant d'affirmer une vision politique et intellectuelle de l'état actuel des choses, afin d'influencer de manière active la dynamique des transformations en cours.
L'hypothèse est que, à travers de micro-interventions il soit possible de construire des dynamiques de développement et de sauvegarde des territoires en crise.
En effet, la mise en œuvre d'une "recolonisation" viable pour la condition spécifique des vallées de montagne doit passer par l'utilisation pertinente et consciente de la culture architecturale.
Dans cette optique, le projet d'architecture permet d'expérimenter des stratégies sensibles et durables dans une condition par sa nature résistante à toute intervention extérieure.
Les bâtiments projetés chercheront à assumer le caractère du lieu au sens positif qui ne se limite pas à lire passivement l'histoire et le présent ou à interpréter le contexte et les figures autochtones, mais qui soit à même d'écrire une contribution originale de la spécificité du lieu au travers des formes de l'architecture.
La recherche d'un équilibre culturel, social et durable se matérialise dans chaque projet architectural et dans la réponse chorale à l'échelle de la vallée étudiée, de l'implantation aux solutions constructives et à la séquence typologique, d'usage et de maintenance.
Le programme de l'atelier s'inscrit dans un dessein plus général de redéfinition critique des concepts d'identité locale et de valeurs traditionnelles afin de soutenir et d'encourager un processus ouvert et partagé de renaissance démographique et culturelle des régions périphériques.
Plus précisément, le programme prévoit de développer un système cohérent d'activités artisanales et d'habitations collectives.
L'ensemble d'une quinzaine de projets, tous à implanter sur des parcelles différentes et en relation les unes avec les autres, constituera un Forum Alpinum, c'est-à-dire un lieu communautaire de rencontre et d'échange.
Concevoir un lieu pour la collectivité dans une condition alpine signifie partir de la condition géographique de son territoire en tant que système, et donc considérer que les fonctions sociales, commerciales et productives sont inséparables les unes des autres.
Is it conceivable to question the very presence of highways in urban environments?
What potential for requalification does this space, with its unique characteristics, offer?
This is the central question that the Design Studio will explore during the spring semester, producing "counter-projects" aimed at overcoming, dismantling, adapting, repurposing, and reconceptualizing the highway barriers still present within the city.
Several Swiss cities are intersected by stretches of the national road network, remnants of a bygone era.
Today, these roads act as barriers to urban movement, sources of air and noise pollution, and spaces of congestion, as the massive traffic volumes they channel into the city are excessive.
The first step is to identify and map these areas;
the second is to develop hypotheses about their potential evolution.
Drawing on existing research, site visits, and project development, the Design Studio will generate ideas and perspectives to be debated collectively and publicly.
****************************************************************** Celle-ci est l'interrogation que l'Atelier développera dans le semestre de printemps qui produira des « contre-projets » urbains de dépassement, démantèlement, adaptation, réutilisation, reconceptualisation des barreaux autoroutiers encore présents dans la ville.
Plusieurs villes suisses sont traversées par des tronçons du réseau des routes nationales helvétiques qui appartiennent à une époque dévolue :
ils agissent, aujourd'hui, comme des barrières aux mouvements de la ville, des pollueurs de l'air et acoustique, des espaces congestionnés car les grands volumes de trafic qu'ils amènent en ville est excessif.
Il s'agit d'abord de les repérer, de les cartographier et, deuxième, de développer des hypothèses de leur évolution.
A partir de recherches déjà développées, de visites des sites et de la construction de projets, l'Atelier fournira des idées et des points de vue à débattre collectivement et publiquement.
La ville comme une maison - La petite maison associative.
Voyage d'étude - Paris LA MAISON COMME UNE VILLE LA PETITE MAISON ASSOCIATIVE DOMESTIC CITY-LAB (DC-LAB) STUDIO SOPHIE DELHAY assistée par Harry Waknine & Melchior Dechancé UNE THEME, L'HABITAT Constituant près de 80 % du grain de la ville, l'habitat est un levier décisif pour encourager les relations sociales, de soin, tout en réduisant nos besoins en ressources et en énergie, afin de faire évoluer la ville et le logement dans un même mouvement.
Travailler sur l'habitat, c'est trouver les formes pour rendre possible un monde plus juste d'un point de vue social, spatial, dans une écologie des rapports humains.
Le studio voit l'habitat comme le point de départ d'une architecture qui met au centre une vie intimement collective et solidaire, et qui explore des territoires à partir de leur caractère domestique.
Espaces et Usages:
L'habitat rend compte de dimensions spatiales, sociales et environnementales.
Ses dimensions spatiales sont proprement liées à la discipline architecturale (à la composition de plan, aux qualités constructives, matérielles, atmosphériques) ;
ses dimensions sociales sont liées aux modes de vie et aux usages ;
ses dimensions environnementales sont liées à ses besoins d'économie d'espace, de moyens, de matière et d'énergie.
Nous pensons l'habitat comme un principe émancipatoire capable, à l'aune des crises sociales et climatiques qui nous traversent, de révolutionner nos villes depuis l'intérieur.
L'habitat est un outil puissant pour concevoir une ville et une société plus justes, plus durables, vertueuses et hédonistes.
Territoires intimes:
Le studio situe l'habitat dans un spectre plus vaste que celui du logement.
L'habitat est un espace tendu entre la petite et la grande échelle :
entre le mobilier et le territoire, l'échelle domestique et l'échelle urbaine, le corps et la ville, le temps court des gestes quotidiens et le temps long des vies qui s'y succèdent.
L'habitat est aussi le lieu où s'entremêlent des usages ordinaires et extraordinaires, des aspects fonctionnels et poétiques, des habitudes et des surprises.
L'habitat est donc à la fois rationnel et poétique, concret et abstrait, immanent et ontologique, fondé sur notre capacité à se projeter, à rêver demain, et à être fondés par notre mémoire et nos désirs.
En bref, l'habitat établit avant tout des rapports, des articulations, et met en perspective des opposés, des notions a priori contradictoires ou habituellement dissociées.
L'habitat est le lieu du lien.
UN OUTIL, LA CUISINE La cuisine est prise comme point de départ des deux semestres.
Tout comme l'architecture, la cuisine est à la fois un espace (une pièce), un usage (le repas), un temps (un rituel), mais aussi un besoin vital (où l'on pourvoit à la subsistance) et un fait culturel (la gastronomie).
C'est aussi une discipline vernaculaire et exploratoire - locale et globale - entre cuisine traditionnelle et nouvelle cuisine.
Nous proposons d'interpréter et d'analyser l'espace de la cuisine sous quatre angles :
- En tant qu'espace social :
lieu où se déroule la commensalité, mais aussi espace approprié par ses habitants à travers la pratique incarnée de la préparation du repas.
- En tant qu'espace politique, révélateur des relations de pouvoir liées au travail productif et reproductif.
Il est aussi l'espace du logement le plus genré.
- En tant qu'espace hédoniste, où la gastronomie et la technique s'allient pour que la subsistance se transforme en plaisir partagé.
- En tant qu'espace climatique, équipé d'une alimentation en eau, d'appareils de cuisson, de réfrigérateurs et d'extracteurs d'air, elle pourrait jouer un rôle important dans le bien-être climatique de l'habitation, comme c'était le cas avant l'ère industrielle.
Pour toutes ces raisons, la cuisine est un outil puissant pour transformer politiquement, socialement et climatiquement la production standardisée de l'habitat.
La cuisine est aussi le lieu des sens et des plaisirs, et peut stimuler une architecture plus hédoniste.
1 RECHERCHE, 2 SEMESTRES Nous vous proposons d'explorer deux scénarios où les distinctions entre intérieur et extérieur, petite dimension et grande dimension, habituellement dévolues d'un côté au logement, de l'autre à la ville, seraient recomposées différemment.
Il s'agirait ici d'une même chose :
l'habitat.
Dans cet esprit, on vivrait la maison comme une ville et la ville comme une maison.
LA MAISON COMME UNE VILLE LA PETITE MAISON ASSOCIATIVE Ce semestre de printemps, le studio étudiera le campus de l'EPFL de manière immersive, à la petite échelle, autour de la question d'un centre estudiantin.
Au-delà des espaces consacrés à l'enseignement, à la recherche et à l'administration, des espaces accueillent la vie de la communauté des étudiant·e·x·s et de leurs associations.
Le studio crée collectivement un portrait domestique du campus de l'EPFL en observant les usages partagés, formels et informels de ces espaces.
Made-in EPFL:
Ce portrait domestique révèle un ensemble de thèmes, à la fois spatiaux et d'usages, spécifiques au campus.
Chacun d'eux est développé par deux groupes à travers un atlas cartographique, et un inventaire qui décrit et classe les situations analogues.
Les atlas cartographiques servent de base à de possibles stratégies de transformation pour le campus, chacune inspirée par son caractère domestique.
Sur cette base, un site est choisi pour la conception d'une maison associative, accueillant les activités des associations et développant l'appropriation par les étudiant·e·x·s de l'ensemble du campus.
Public Interior:
Le centre étudiant est conçu comme un espace public intérieur répondant aux besoins non académiques des étudiant·e·s.
Il offre un accès à des services, des espaces et des programmes, rapproche les différentes communautés, favorise l'engagement et l'organisation de la vie associative du campus.
Les projets s'appuieront sur la théorie du Public Interior explorée par Mark Pimlott dans son livre The Public Interior as Idea and Project, qui comprend le Palace, la Ruine, le Réseau, le Jardin, et la Machine.
Partages:
Au-delà du programme attendu, l'alimentation, par sa dimension sociale et économique, servira de prétexte aux liens tissés entre étudiant·e·x·s.
La conception d'une cafétéria autogérée offrira un espace privilégié pour questionner les modalités d'accès à une alimentation quotidienne abordable, tout en explorant la dimension collective qui peut émerger autour du partage du repas.
Greenhouse Studies explore le potentiel des structures de serres dans le contexte des défis contemporains.
Les ateliers de projet étudient les serres comme un type architectural sensible au climat, capable de transformer des structures existantes en espaces collectifs et communautaires.
GREENHOUSE STUDIES III 'Clothing as an extension of our skin helps to store and to channel energy, ...If clothing is an extension of our private skins to store and channel our own heat and energy, housing is a collective means of achieving the same end for the family or the group.
Housing as shelter is an extension of our bodily heat-control mechanisms - a collective skin or garment.' Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media:
The Extensions of Man (Cambridge:
MIT Press, 1911) Following a first design studio on greenhouses, Laboratory EAST presents Greenhouse Studies II - The collective (Fall semester), and Greenhouse studies III - The common (Spring semester), the laboratory's second and third interaction with a unique element in the history of architecture.
The studio is interested in the multiple uses of greenhouse spaces outside the horticultural context.
In Greenhouse Studies I, the design studio took a cross-sectional look at domestic greenhouses as a space for expanding the individual home.
The greenhouse served as garden for vegetables, as passive heating device, or extra living room.
Through superposition, juxtaposition, or all-over solutions, the greenhouse spatial structure constituted a new thermal buffer zone that interacted differently with the existing volumes.
In Greenhouse Studies II and III, the studio will continue the survey, aware of new dimensions:
from the individual to the collective, from the collective to the common, from the small villa scale to the collective housing, from collective housing to common programs.
Together we will build on these concepts while exploring greenhouse-like solutions.
What are the implications of such change?
The results will contribute to an open-source, collaborative database that will grow each semester.
Type and Typology as framework Typology is recognised as a fundamental concept for a better understanding of architecture and its history.
It serves as a basic framework, a kind of tacit backbone for the organisation of architectural knowledge and can also be a tool for generating new architectural solutions.
Some argue that typology is as old as architecture itself, as it involves the reproduction of dominant types and models that are deeply rooted in socio-cultural realities.
Alternatively, it can be said that architecture responds to new social and economic needs by inventing or revising existing types.
Typology and types traditionally interact with the formal dimension (buildings organised by a common form or element) and the functional dimension (buildings organised by a common function).
However, this focus has often overlooked other, less tangible possibilities, such as structural relationships between types and climate in architecture.
Climatic Type as central theme Conservatories, greenhouses, glasshouses, forcing houses, hothouses, invernaderos in Spanish, orangeries, jardins d' hiver or serres in French - many are the terms associated with the idea of housing plants.
All of these artefacts have a common goal:
to create a climate adapted to plant life.
Although greenhouses were conceived with a very precise objective, this climatic space quickly became an exhibition space, a social space, and even a space for celebrations before it fell into disuse.
In the second half of the 20th century, greenhouse-based solutions made a comeback, fostering solar architecture and reinforcing the foundations of bioclimatic architecture in western societies.
During this time, horticulture continued developing greenhouses as productive spaces, and innovations led to intensive fields of production.
In absolute terms, it is not the form or function that characterizes the greenhouse but the definition of a space with specific climatic conditions.
In most cases, using wood or metal structures and transparent materials such as glass, these structures keep a very low ratio between the material used and the enclosed space, offering the most with the least.
The characterization of the greenhouse as an artefact of a climatic nature suggests that the greenhouse as a type does not depend on scale or size.
Since its inception, the multiform and multifunctional greenhouse space has been transformed into a social space with very specific microclimatic characteristics.
Commons 2.10.1976.
- The office is set up;
it rains lightly but gets steadily inside the office.
11.10.1976 - Today is my first day of work at the office;
everything works.
14.10.1976 - The moisture problem has not yet been solved, the drawing paper is curling;the flowers are growing.
14.4.1977 - The greenhouse is not ventilated, the sun is shining, the inside temperature is 48 degrees Celsius at 12 o-clock, opening the ventilation flaps immediately reduces it to 24 degrees.
From Log Id's logbook.
In LOG ID (ed.), Gruene Archen - Harmonie mit Pflanzen leben das Modell der Gruppe LOG ID (Frankfurt am Main:
Fricke Verlag, 1983) Unfolding over the course of two semesters, both design studios will explore the dynamics between greenhouses, greenhouse components or greenhouse functions and existing building structures as architectural forms, climatic spaces and temporary uses of space:
In the spring semester, Greenhouse studies III - The common, we focus exclusively on the communal dimensions of the greenhouse as a place for work and social interaction.
The design studio will investigate how climate-based architecture can be implemented by designing a student house at EPFL Campus.
The common space should be the centre of the student community and a critical review of contemporary space utilisation.
The development of both phases will be undertaken in groups consisting of two or three students, and a Seminar Day will comprise a series of multidisciplinary theoretical contributions from external experts.
We will investigate the possible interactions between two different architectural spaces, and gain a better understanding of the typological transfers and climatic synergies between them.
Greenhouse-like structures offer the opportunity to investigate prefabricated systems, test designs for deconstruction and reversibility in design thinking, and ultimately find a 'lighter' way to redesign existing buildings.
By looking at greenhouses as specific built environments, the studio will formulate solutions based on the concept of architecture as atmosphere, while exploring its transformative potential.
In addition, the studio will examine greenhouses as climate-responsive artefacts, exploring how seasons can change spaces, or, in other words, what it means to inhabit spaces seasonally.
If we change clothes according to the seasons, should our buildings change too?
Practicalities Each semester will be composed of two parts.
The first part - Research on precedents - will be developed individually to expand the corpus of references and help us learn from existing buildings.
The studio will collectively build a visual atlas made of peculiar, strange or remarkable case-studies.
The design study will analyse the characteristics of the case studies, like:
flexible use of space, evaluate their thermal behaviour throughout the seasons, formmaking aspects, thermical airflow and mechanics of openings.
The key findings from this body of references will inform the design phase.
In the second part - Design Studio - participants will develop their own design in groups of two or three.
Learning outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to:
Apply and present research capable to inform a design project Analyse and interpret critically an architectural work Formulate a problem and provide design-based solution Represent accurately a design proposal with drawings and models at multiple scales Develop a narrative and present arguments to specialised and non-specialised audiences Develop awareness about the implicit and explicit messages of an architectural project Work collaboratively and integrate knowledge from different disciplines
This studio explores construction materials, their origins and supply chains, the norms that regulate their use, and deploys that as a brief to explore how a post-extractive architecture could emerge and become prevalent.

Course Description:Nota Bene:
This studio is part of the 'Moratorium on New Construction' cycle, one of RIOT's meta agenda, following a series of topics seeking to center systemic change in architecture and the building industry.
This means the class will prioritize radical designs that engage with repair, remediation, care, tactical interventions, system design and policy making, and interrogate architecture as the sole 'art of building buildings.' Architecture is here at the forefront, considered both as a problem but also as a powerful tool for change, if and when it is used as such.

Marston / Paul Christopher Brown, © Sony/atv Songs Llc, Imagem Publishing Ltd.
'Halt Extraction' scrutinizes the intersection of design disciplines with extractivism and resource exploitation, focusing on developing post-extractive architectural and urban design strategies.
The studio investigates how construction materials transform the Earth's resources into our built environment through global and local supply chains, and how design can contribute to post-extractive architectures.
Grounded in arguments explored in the forthcoming book "A Moratorium on New Construction," we seek to address the political problems of construction as designers.
The course progresses through two main phases:
1) The research phase establishes a comprehensive understanding of how design disciplines intersect with extractivism and resource exploitation through mapping the global and local chains of construction materials and uncovering the normative systems in place that regulate their use in design strategies.
By investigating construction materials (i.e., plaster, wood, concrete, brick, steel) and their political economy (how value is extracted from them), we hope to unpack how the industry translates the Earth's resources into our built environment.
We also seek to understand the normative regulations, specs, and legal frameworks that dictate how these materials are deployed in construction.
2) Framed by these regulatory limits and equipped with critical thinking, we will devise design strategies that do not rely on destruction and exhaustion to produce spaces.
During the design phase, building on this foundation, we will engage with mainly existing structures rather than defaulting to new construction, using current market conditions as testing grounds for alternative approaches.
Site We will work in real-life conditions in the context of Switzerland.
Scales This studio is based on a conception of urban design as a multidimensional trans-scalar discipline.
Not only political, economic, social, cultural, and geo-tectonic forces affect and shape the built environment at the planetary and global scale, at the territorial and landscape scale, at the neighborhood and urban scale, down to the architectural and material scale - and to the body of the human and more-than-human, but space and its arrangements have a reciprocating effect on these forces, humans, and non-humans acting upon them.
We will design within these gradations, positing that each constituent scale is distinct and can be considered on its own, yet the piece as a whole is only complete with each scale, resulting in the sum of all the small scales producing a large-scale total.[2] The studio engages with complex issues surrounding the political economy of space production, the actors, forces and mechanisms that generate the spaces we inhabit.
We will also think around temporal scales to challenge "impatient capital" as it dictates architectural, urban, and landscape projects for immediacy, exploring seemingly contradictory notions of ephemeral and impermanent, durable, and longevity as frameworks for operation.
L'atelier consiste en une mise en situation de projet dans l'existant, à a fois concrète et prospective.
Celle-ci s'étend du diagnostic à la réhabilitation, en passant par la reprogrammation.
La création d'un Student Center sur le campus historique de l'EPFL (1984) est notre objet d'étude.
EPFL Student Center L'atelier ADHER s'est proposé de contribuer à la réflexion collective quant à la création d'un Student Center sur le campus de l'EPFL.
Ce projet prévoit le regroupement des locaux des diverses associations de l'EPFL, pour libérer des surfaces d'enseignement et de recherche et simplifier l'organisation d'évènements.
Ce faisant, il s'agit de répondre à la demande des étudiants d'avoir un espace qui leur est dédié.
Celui-ci intègrera salles de réunion, bureaux et stockage de matériel sur environ 3.000 m2.
Parmi les différents ateliers impliqués dans ce processus de manière critique et proactive, l'atelier ADHER, de par sa méthodologie, propose que ce projet s'incarne nécessairement à travers une intervention en prise directe avec le bâtiment historique de 1984 :
transformation, surélévation, extension, etc.
Le potentiel du patrimoine La mise au jour du potentiel d'un bâti existant, qu'il soit protégé ou ordinaire, implique son étude préalable.
À travers elle, il s'agit de s'approprier les méthodes et les outils spécifiques de l'étude patrimoniale.
Leur maîtrise, à laquelle tend à initier cette première séquence, participe d'une meilleure compréhension de ce qui est déjà là, en vue d'une intervention.
Il s'agit également de prendre conscience que cette étude constitue une part intégrante du projet et pas seulement une phase liminaire, dépourvue d'intentions conceptuelles.
L'étude patrimoniale intègre le relevé de l'existant sur site, son étude historique et sa critique d'authenticité à partir des archives ainsi que son diagnostic technique et sanitaire.
La mener à bien suppose d'adopter une démarche pluridisciplinaire en impliquant des spécialistes tels que des ingénieurs, des entreprises et des chercheurs.
Cette phase d'étude constitue également une opportunité de s'interroger sur les modes de représentation de l'architecture et du paysage.
Par ailleurs, il est important de rappeler que l'ensemble de ces méthodes et outils ne constitue pas seulement un corpus figé de procédés expérimentés mais bien un champ de recherche contemporain, expérimental et continu.
Restaurer, transformer, créer Il existe différents types d'intervention dans l'existant, de la restauration à la création, en passant par la transformation.
Ces derniers ne doivent pas être déterminés a priori mais résulter des conclusions de l'étude patrimoniale, en particulier de celles relatives à la valeur patrimoniale.
Le potentiel de celle-ci ne se révèlera concrètement qu'à travers ces interventions.
Pour servir au présent, l'existant peut ainsi nécessiter une restauration, totale ou partielle, impliquer une transformation d'une de ses parties, voire exiger une création, sous la forme d'une extension par exemple.
De plus, au-delà du type d'intervention, se pose la question du parti pris.
En effet, chacun de ces types se décline pour participer au mieux à un projet cohérent.
Ces interventions doivent être contextualisées (c'est-à-dire définies par rapport au site, aux matériaux, aux mises en œuvre, etc.) et inscrites parmi celles de nombreux partenaires (ingénieurs et entreprises spécialisés).
Bioclimatisme et enjeux contemporains L'intervention dans l'existant est une pratique ancienne bien que résolument contemporaine, en phase avec les enjeux écologiques et sociaux d'aujourd'hui.
Elle attire notre attention sur la capacité d'adaptation de ce qui est déjà là et de ce que nous construisons.
Cette adaptabilité s'entend bien sûr sur le plan des usages mais également sur ceux de l'environnement et du confort, notamment face au dérèglement climatique.
Ainsi, une intervention dans l'existant nécessite de l'appréhender au prisme d'une conception bioclimatique.
En phase d'étude, cela signifie d'en identifier les faiblesses thermiques, hygrométriques et acoustiques mais aussi les potentialités d'éclairage et de ventilation naturels.
En phase de projet, il ne s'agit donc pas de mettre en œuvre des solutions ex nihilo mais davantage d'optimiser l'isolation, de valoriser les apports solaires ou encore d'améliorer la ventilation naturelle.
Pour ce faire et poursuivre un objectif d'une moindre empreinte carbone, on peut privilégier le recours à la végétation, l'utilisation de matériaux biosourcés ou encore le remploi de matériaux.
Loin de nous décourager, ces enjeux doivent donc nous responsabiliser et nous pousser à agir en nous saisissant, par exemple, du patrimoine comme d'une ressource et un point d'appui générateur de projet.
Conception of collective housing within real-world constraints, through the problematized handling of a variety of modes of representation.
good housing.
Topic, context, economies.The aim of the semester is to propose alternatives forms of housing in conditions as close as possible to that of actual practice, and to make virtue out their concrete limitations.
Low budgets and narrow-minded norms will become opportunities, all participating in shaping the possibility of something that could be called good housing.
Multiplicity, ambition.The semester will sail against the idea that an academic exercise has to be reductive, and that the complexities of the whole cannot be grasped at once by a project.
Through precise and multi-faceted projects, we will thus reduce to minimum the distances between what is good for each inhabitant, what is good for the neighbors, what is good for the urban setting, what is good according to the givens of a brief, what is good in terms of sustainability, in terms of affordability, in terms of beauty, in terms of construction, or in terms of the sensible distribution of spatial resources.
Housing as choreography.
Housing as act.No lens is ever neutral, passive, or objective.
Starting from plans inevitably leads to a different project than doing it from collages or details.
The way one furnishes or not a perspective is similarly charged with implications and meanings.One of the objectives of the semester is to shape clear standpoints regarding this necessary state of failed objectivity.
Throughout the development of the work, representation will problematized as a set of tools allowing to rethink the conditions of intelligibility of a given problem â here public housing.
A wide array of modes of representation will be experimented with, selected, used and distorted, according to specific intents, ultimately shaping the projects themselves and their focus.
Typological Urbanism bridges architecture and urbanism through dual perspectives:
architectural typologies shaping urban form from within, and urban types shaping it from without.
Working across scales, the studio explores evolving Swiss urban contexts through ensemble and composite forms.
Architecture versus Urbanism The term Typological Urbanism refers to a design method situated at the overlap of architecture and urbanism.
In our understanding, urbanism is neither the outcome of engineered masterplans - where form is determined and filled with program - nor the product of a loose collection of autonomous architectural objects.
Instead, we believe in a strong interdependency between architecture and urbanism.
We recognize a conceptual gap in practice between these two disciplines.
Typological Urbanism allows us to respond with precision to the multiple dimensions of the urban condition - context, program, and existing fabric - without relying on idealistic projections.
Instead, it operates through inherent rules:
robust yet flexible enough to be reassembled in every moment.
This assemblage relies in a fluent state, like the work of Imi Knoebel it can feel assembled and disassembled at the same time.
This ambiguity and open-endedness enable appropriation and identification.
A Dual Approach Typological Urbanism can be approached from two complementary directions:
From within:
architectural typologies (such as housing) generate spatial organization and in turn shape urban form.
From without:
predefined or emergent urban types constitute our built environment, including aspects such as open space, program, ownership, and accessibility.
This duality reflects the legacy of modernist thought - its search for rationality - and its postmodern revision, which reintroduced context, memory, and multiplicity into design.
Synthesizing these principles enables us to resist both dogmatism and nostalgia.
Working Across Scales This duality is not contradictory;
on the contrary, it becomes our design method.
To investigate it, we will work simultaneously on two scales:
the individual unit and the urban figure.
By studying how these two levels interact, we aim to reveal deeper spatial relationships.
Our starting point will be specific housing typologies, through which we will analyse spatial logics and organizational principles.
From there, we will scale outward - investigating how abstract volumes relate to one another within a larger spatial composition.
The central question becomes:
can the relationships and conditions identified at the architectural scale be translated into, or discovered within, the urban dimension?
Sites of Urban Reassembly In the Swiss context, urban development is no longer driven by expansion into open land, but by the densification and transformation of existing environments.
Within these already-defined boundaries, most areas transitioning from industrial or infrastructural uses to residential, commercial, services or public functions have now been developed.
Yet some questions remain.
Our investigations extend beyond these specific zones and apply equally to the mixed-use city, to urban areas growing across municipal lines, to agglomerations evolving into coherent urban forms, and to housing settlements striving for greater density and urban character.
Urban Ensemble or Urban Composite Over the course of the academic year, each semester will prioritize one aspect of this duality within a design project:
Semester 1:
The Urban Ensemble (Zurich):
Focused on how urban form emerges from the interaction of typologies in a loose arrangement of buildings.
Semester 2:
The Urban Composite (Lausanne):
Investigates the idea of a hybrid building - a type in itself that incorporates multiple typologies.
Challenging outdated zoning laws, we will apply a consistent programmatic set in each context - a mix of uses tailored to local conditions, yet designed to ensure that a piece of city can emerge and evolve.
Le studio Weinand adopte une approche de conception axée sur l'expérimentation des matériaux et le prototypage, en se concentrant sur le bois, les herbes et la terre.
À l'IBOIS, une riche expérience guide l'exploration de prototypes reliant concepts architecturaux et réalité construite.
Du prototype au bâtiment L'IBOIS met l'accent sur des approches de conception guidées par les matériaux.
L'année dernière, ils ont introduit la Structure en plaques de bois à fixation intégrale (IATPS), qui relie directement la conception numérique au processus de fabrication.
Les technologies numériques ont transformé le rôle de l'architecte, désormais aussi celui d'un fabricant.
L'objectif est de trouver les usages optimaux pour des matériaux spécifiques et des comportements structurels précis.
Ces outils numériques réduisent également les coûts de communication tout au long du processus de conception.
Aujourd'hui, les prototypes offrent un moyen de communication efficace entre l'homme et la machine, et peuvent être produits à moindre coût grâce à la fabrication numérique.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'un prototype?
En architecture, un prototype est une maquette à l'échelle réelle ou réduite, utilisée pour tester, affiner et explorer un projet avant la construction.
Il comble l'écart entre les idées abstraites et leur mise en œuvre physique, en révélant les qualités spatiales, les performances matérielles, les méthodes de construction et l'interaction avec l'utilisateur.
Contrairement aux modèles virtuels, les prototypes physiques permettent un engagement direct et facilitent l'évaluation de la viabilité réelle d'un projet.
Les prototypes architecturaux ont toujours servi d'outils d'expérimentation - des modèles en plâtre complexes de Gaudí aux constructions à l'échelle 1:1 comme la Khudi Bari au Bangladesh.
Qu'ils soient utilisés pour répondre à des conditions environnementales, à des défis constructifs ou à des besoins communautaires, les prototypes permettent aux architectes de tester des concepts radicaux tout en minimisant les risques.
En particulier dans les contextes à faibles ressources, le prototypage associe crèativité et nécessité, aboutissant à des structures innovantes et adaptatives, ancrées dans des conditions réelles.
En s'appuyant sur les recherches passées en matière de prototypage et de matériaux, le Studio Weinand organise une série d'ateliers centrés sur la fabrication numérique, complétés par des visites de sites afin d'observer directement l'application des matériaux et les contextes constructifs.
Ces sessions relient les concepts de conception à leur réalisation physique en encourageant l'expérimentation à l'échelle réelle.
Ici, le prototypage n'est pas seulement une technique, mais un état d'esprit - qui redéfinit notre approche du processus constructif.
Travailler directement avec des matériaux bruts remet en question les méthodes linéaires conventionnelles de conception et incite à une réévaluation critique de l'ensemble de la chaîne de production et d'approvisionnement, avec pour objectif de réduire l'empreinte écologique de la construction en bois.
From Prototype to Building IBOIS emphasizes material-driven design approaches.
Last year, they introduced the Integrally-Attached Timber Plate Structure (IATPS), which connects digital design directly to the fabrication process.
Digital technologies have shifted the architect's role into that of a maker.
The goal is to find optimal uses for specific materials and structural behaviours.
These digital tools also lower communication costs across the design process.
Today, prototypes offer an efficient medium of communication between human and machine and can be produced affordably using digital fabrication.
So, what is a prototype?
In architecture, a prototype is a full-scale or scaled-down model used to test, refine, and explore a design before construction.
It closes the gap between abstract ideas and physical implementation, revealing spatial qualities, material performance, building methods, and user interaction.
Unlike virtual models, physical prototypes allow direct engagement and make it easier to assess a design's real-world viability.
Architectural prototypes have always served as tools for experimentation-from Gaudi's intricate plaster models to today's 1:1 construction like the Khudi Bari in Bangladesh.
Whether used to address environmental conditions, construction challenges, or community needs, prototypes allow architects to test radical concepts while minimizing risk.
Especially in low-resource settings, prototyping blends creativity with necessity, resulting in innovative, adaptive structures grounded in real-life conditions.
In this studio workshop, we focus on three material themes.
First, interlocking self-bearing watertight envelops from timber.
Second, interlocking self-bearing watertight envelops from grasses.
Third, actively bended interlaced timber grids with projected earth.
The timber project, led by IBOIS, involves stacked trunks and watertight joinery.
The grasses' theme explores how vernacular traditions use layered bundles to create water-resistant shelter, reimagined through digital tools.
Lastly, bending timber grids form curved structures.
When layered with earth, they improve thermal insulation and protect the timber.
We'll propose ways to build these structures using spraying techniques and digital methods.
Building on the foundation of past research into prototyping and materials, Studio Weinand organizes a series of workshops centred on digital fabrication, complemented by site visits to observe material application and construction contexts firsthand.
These sessions connect design concepts with physical realization by encouraging full-scale experimentation.
Here, prototyping is not just a technique but a mindset - one that redefines how we approach the construction process.
Working directly with raw materials challenges conventional linear design workflows and prompts a critical revaluation of the entire production and supply chain, with the goal of reducing the ecological footprint of timber construction.
Une intervention humanitaire d'urgence, à savoir la mise en place d'un Early Childhood Development Centre dans le camp de réfugiés de Zaatari, en Jordanie, fait l'objet du design studio.
Le projet s'inscrit dans la continuité des expériences précédentes menées au sein du laboratoire FAR.
Bien que les camps de réfugiés soient de plus en plus considérés comme la dernière option en cas d'urgence, et qu'il existe aujourd'hui un large débat sur les différentes stratégies et approches permettant de les éviter, le camp reste une réalité qu'il est difficile d'éliminer, d'ignorer ou de négliger.
La pertinence de cette question est d'autant plus grande si l'on considère la tendance des camps à se transformer en établissements permanents.
Cette expérience examinera comment la conception architecturale peut répondre aux besoins fondamentaux et aux conditions difficiles qui caractérisent les scénarios humanitaires.
Quant à la conception visant la coopération pour le développement, il existe des possibles catégories d'interventions, avec des incursions de noms importants du panorama architectural qui feront l'objet d'une analyse et d'une réflexion.
Le camp de réfugiés constitue probablement le terme extrême auquel se référer pour questionner les limites, les conditions et les potentialités de la conception architecturale :
les conditions d'urgence (avec leur corollaire de ressources limitées et d'impérativité intrinsèque des interventions) sont généralement utilisées pour justifier des approches managériales et technocratiques, qui semblent exclure l'espace pour le discours architectural, perçu (et souvent présenté) comme auxiliaire, voire complètement hors de propos.
Pour recueillir des données sur le contexte, une approche médico-légale, désormais pratiquée dans ces contextes et dans des contextes similaires, peut être déployée sur la base de la quantité considérable d'informations disponibles.
A la suite de cette analyse des informations disponibles et à l'étude des références, les étudiant-e-s sont censé-e-s développer un mode d'intervention cohérent et réaliste.
Ils-Elles seront appelé-e-s à concevoir un système constructif intégré reproduisible dans des circonstances similaires, un prototype pouvant entrer dans le circuit de production, industriel ou non.
Although refugee camps are increasingly seen as the last option in case of emergency, and there is now widespread debate about different strategies and approaches to avoid them, the camp remains a reality which is difficult to eliminate, ignore or neglect.
The relevance of this issue is made all the more pressing where one considers the tendency of camps to turn into permanent settlements.
This experience will consider how architectural design can respond to the basic needs and difficult conditions that characterise humanitarian scenarios.
As for design aimed at cooperation for development there are possible categorizations of the interventions, with incursions by prominent names of the architectural panorama that will be the subject of analysis and reflection.
The refugee camp probably constitutes the extreme term to refer to when questioning the limits, conditions, and potentialities of architectural design:
emergency conditions (with their corollary of limited resources and intrinsic urgency of interventions) usually are used to justify managerial and technocratic approaches, which seem to exclude space for architectural discourse, perceived (and often presented) as ancillary when even completely irrelevant.
Following this analysis of the available information and the study of references, students are expected to develop a coherent and realistic mode of intervention.
Students will be required to conceive an integrated building system to be replicated in similar circumstances, a prototype that can enter the production circuit, industrial or otherwise.
The studio examines the effects of artificial intelligence on architecture and cities.
We explore data-driven design processes by the use of algorithmic and parametric tools that take into consideration geographical, economical, personal, image, political, ecological parameters.
The advent of new digital technologies has had a twofold impact on architectural thinking and urban design, transforming, on one hand, the processes for form generation and design production through algorithmic and parametric technologies, and, on the other hand, enabling an escape from the static fate of the built environment by facilitating dynamic interaction between inhabitants and their surrounding.
Our interest in the orientation "Form + Data" is to explore meaningful form generating processes by the use of data-driven design, algorithmic and parametric tools.
While developing a base of digital evidence specific to each site, each studio will explore novel means of deploying this data to support design and generate form.
The intellectual aim of the studio is to question the extent by which the data-scape can support architects to generate urban and architectural form.
Our interest is directed at the decoding and recoding of two distinct domains of knowledge:
exteriority which represents a many-layered geographic condition and anteriority which represents the embedded knowledge of local architectural typologies and systems.
While the exteriority of geographic data is crucial to our research, we place a primary emphasis on the generative potential of typology- what we have called "growth typologies".
Decoding anterior form and then recoding and deploying it across new territories allows us to challenge the role of architecture in urban developments of increased scale and complexity.
En poursuivant notre exploration du concept d'hétérotopies, nous nous pencherons sur la transformation des barres de logements dans le quartier de Sarcelles.
Ce travail sera enrichi par une analyse des textes de Michel Foucault ainsi que par une représentation des espaces qu'il décrit.
Hétérotopies 95 200 Simplisme vs complexitéEn ce moment de crise politique globale, où la montée de l'extrême droite et de l'illibéralisme, aux États-Unis, en Europe ou encore dans le Sud global, menace la démocratie et notre capacité à vivre ensemble, il est primordial de réfléchir à la manière dont l'architecture peut ouvrir la voie vers de nouveaux agencements du réel.
Ces agencements doivent échapper à une vision binaire et simpliste du monde pour mieux se confronter à sa complexité.
Les questionnements qui traversent notre époque - la crise climatique, les questions d'identité, la place de la vérité, .- appellent un engagement qui s'adresse à la fois à la multiplicité et au temps long.
Un engagement qui se confronte ainsi à la tension féconde entre spécificité et universalité.Pour continuer de questionner l'architecture de manière critique et la réévaluer, esthétiquement et politiquement, à la lumière de ce contexte contemporain, nous poursuivrons ce semestre notre investigation du concept d'hétérotopie énoncé par le philosophe français Michel Foucault.
Non pas avec la prétention de faire de la philosophie en tant que telle, mais afin de comprendre comment une philosophie peut nous aider à penser notre propre discipline et ses attendus, dès lors que nous l'abordons avec nos regards d'architectes.Michel Foucault a été un penseur pionnier dans la mise en relation de plans de réalité que personne ne connectait avant lui.
Il a su montrer que le progrès technique, les modes de constitution de la connaissance, la morale, le comptage du temps, la mesure de l'espace, la perception et le statut de nos corps eux-mêmes étaient liés au sein de notre organisation sociale.
L'étude de leurs évolutions respectives, subtilement entrelacées, met en lumière des enjeux de pouvoir jusqu'alors insoupçonnés, dont la conscience nourrit, désormais, largement la pensée contemporaine.
Le concept d'hétérotopie, qu'il a énoncé en 1966 et qui s'apparente à des utopies construites et localisées, appartient à la description de ces ensembles jusqu'alors inconnus.
Il nous intéresse, en tant qu'architectes, à deux titres principaux.
D'une part, car il défini-t une catégorie nouvelle à partir de l'énoncé d'un critère - l'utopie construite en l'occurrence.
Une telle démarche est une sorte de métaphore du projet architectural qui, lui aussi, gagne à se livrer à la révision de concepts ou types connus par l'énonciation préalable de critères.
D'autre part, car l'hétérotopie se situe à l'intersection immédiate de l'espace, de l'organisation sociale et de l'imagination collective, soulignant ainsi la dimension, par définition, politique de tout acte architectural.
Sarcelles, hétérotopiqueC'est donc à partir du concept d'hétérotopie que nous travaillerons au semestre de printemps pour imaginer la transformation d'immeubles existants de la ville de Sarcelles.
En effet, le concept foucaldien résonne particulièrement avec ce grand ensemble de la taille d'une ville (12 000 logements) construit en vingt ans dans le nord du Grand Paris.
Tant par sa taille que par la cohérence formelle de ses différentes parties, la ville de Sarcelles se distingue de nombreux grands ensembles par sa capacité à produire une ville moderne vivante et pas une simple juxtaposition de logements.Les architectes du projet, Henri Boileau (1909-1989) et Jacques-Henri Labourdette (1915-2003), appartenaient à une tradition d'architectes modernes qui, à l'instar de Fernand Pouillon (1912-1986), avaient été formés par le pionnier du logement moderne Eugène Beaudoin (1898-1983).
Cette tradition se caractérise par un intérêt particulier pour la relation entre les pleins et les vides, entre les bâtiments et la qualité des espaces qu'ils produisent entre eux, et une reconnaissance de la qualité des espaces délimités.
C'est cette qualité que l'on retrouve à Sarcelles, comme dans les réalisations de Fernand Pouillon, telles que l'ensemble de logements du Point du Jour à Boulogne, que Boileau et Labourdette ont achevé après l'incarcération de leur auteur.Un regard attentif aux qualités matérielles et sensibles existantes sera le point de départ de notre recherche de projet.
Depuis de nombreuses années, l'Agence Nationale de la Rénovation Urbaine (ANRU), est en charge de l'aménagement des quartiers de grands ensembles.
Mue par une incompréhension crasse des attendus de la ville moderne et aveugle à toute reconnaissance de ses qualités ou potentiels, l'ANRU manie l'arme de la démolition à tout va.
À Sarcelles, notamment, elle a démoli des immeubles construits en pierre de taille pour les remplacer par des plots en béton isolés par l'extérieur, sans aucun égard ni pour les coûts, tant sociaux qu'environnementaux d'une telle politique.
Notre travail de studio vise clairement, comme nous l'avons déjà fait l'en dernier, à proposer des alternatives à la démolition en exprimant tout le potentiel que ces bâtiments et ces formes urbaines ont, sans pour autant ignorer leurs limites.
Nous projèterons des transformations qui amplifieront le caractère hétérotopique des lieux.
Contrairement au premier semestre, où nous avions envisagé la création d'un habitat à destination de communautés ultra-spécifiques, il s'agira ici de penser des lieux de vie, certes toujours avec une organisation spatiale précise et des usages spécifiques, mais capable de bénéficier et de s'adresser au cette fois au plus grand nombre.
Ce faisant, nous réfléchirons aux tensions fertiles qui se nouent entre la spécificité de l'espace domestique et sa capacité à accueillir des habitants encore inconnus, qui est au cœur de la conception du logement :
« La maison à loyer est le lieu commun de l'architecture, lieu commun qui doit briller par le sens commun.
Elle doit convenir à la foule, non à la façon d'une mode éphémère, mais à titre d'installation invariablement confortable et décente.
» disait déjà César Daly, théoricien de l'haussmannisme, au milieu du XIXe siècle.
Les hétérotopies de Sarcelles ne requerront plus une appartenance à une communauté spécifique (le retrait du monde commun pour faire apparaître de nouveaux mondes en propre), mais devront remettre en jeu un mouvement d'ouverture et de reconquête d'un monde en partage.
Nous imaginons que cela passe par une réflexion - allant jusqu'à l'inversion - sur les mouvements respectivement centripètes des espaces de l'intime et centrifuges des espaces du collectif.Concrètement, des objets domestiques appartenant traditionnellement au logement acqerront dans les projets une dimension collective qui leur permettent d'être partagés au delà du foyer.
En quittant ce dernier, ces objets-espaces re-configureront les typologies, les usages, les habitudes et les rituels pour des habitants nouveaux et déjà présents dans les immeubles de Sarcelles.
Nous explorerons l'hypothèse d'un bâtiment transformé par l'hypertrophie positive d'un de ses usages domestiques.
Que serait un logement informé, avant tout, par l'imaginaire et les nécessités de la chambre à coucher?
Ou par l'imaginaire et les nécessités de cuisine?
De la salle de bains?
Du séjour?
Et ainsi de suite.
Mais aussi, que serait un bâtiment entier conçu suivant de tels principes?
Un prétexte pour repenser, réévaluer, remettre en cause, la question de la fonctionnalité ou de la mono fonctionnalité, d'une part, mais aussi de devenir plus conscients des imaginaires et nécessités attachés à chacune des pièces de l'habitation conçue de manière traditionnelle.
Le tout en confrontation avec la vie et la question du logement, de ses usages, et des structures familiales qui les occupent, etc.
Nous imaginerons ainsi les implications concrètes d'un tel changement au sein d'une série de barres existantes afin de créer de nouveaux standards spatiaux, typologiques, et sociaux.
Enfin et tel que nous l'avons initié au semestre d'automne 2024, nous développerons un mode de présentation des projets qui porte en lui-même une dimension hétérotopique, c'est-à-dire capable de condenser espace et temps à l'intérieur d'un même support et d'ouvrir le dessin d'architecture au mouvement du récit.
Ce mode de présentation repose sur un dispositif simple et ouvert à la manipulation :
un ensemble de pages A4 assemblées entre elles et formant une grille.
Ces pages fermées forment une première grande image du projet et derrière celle-ci s'ouvre une multitude de fenêtres sur différents aspects du projet.
Ces fenêtres peuvent s'ouvrir encore, à la manière d'une poupée-russe de papier, pour démultiplier les points de vue et offrir un approfondissement spatial et temporel supplémentaire à cette architecture-monde.
Explorations parallèlesEn parallèle du travail hétérotopique de projet, deux explorations plus théoriques viendront nourrir l'expérience du studio.
Tout d'abord, un travail de production d'images permettra de documenter une série d'hétérotopies reprenant les catégories originelles de Foucault.
Cela permettra de constituer un répertoire de références communes et contribuera à nourrir l'imaginaire formel et conceptuel du collectif que nous constituerons durant ce semestre.Par ailleurs, les étudiants se pencheront précisément sur les deux retranscriptions des conférences où Michel Foucault élabore le concept d'hétérotopies.
Ces deux textes, rédigés à un an d'intervalle, entre 1966 et 1967, présentent un certain nombre de différences qu'il s'agira de relever et d'analyser de manière critique.
Cette recherche sera l'occasion de se familiariser avec le concept et d'en cerner les potentiels et les limites.Ces deux explorations théoriques - les images d'hétérotopies et la comparaison critique des deux textes de Foucault - seront regroupées au sein d'un fascicule qui constituera une des productions collectives du studio pour le jury final.Un voyage à Paris sera organisé afin de visiter Sarcelles mais aussi une série de bâtiments significatifs et en relation avec le concept d'hétérotopie.
Ce voyage sera ainsi l'occasion d'éprouver le plaisir de partager collectivement l'expérience de l'architecture selon un plan de coupe singulier sur le réel.Les deux premiers jours du studio seront un séminaire de lancement où l'équipe enseignante et des invités délivreront une série de conférences consacrées à toutes sortes de questions en lien avec le projet, des plus conceptuelles aux plus prosaïques.
This course introduces the students to text programming practice in 3D modeling (Rhinoceros3D).
The main objective of the course is to develop a computational mindset to maximize the use of efficient digital tools in architectural design.
This course is composed of 4 modules:
3D modeling (CAD) where the fundamentals of geometry are reviewed and advanced techniques of 3D modeling are covered.
Introduction to Python (IDE, variables, functions, etc) and object-oriented programming (OOP) where the basics of programming are studied.
Basics of Computational modeling where students will be introduced to and use RhinoCommon (API, documentation, general data structure, main library objects and usage) to produce basic geometric elements and operations through scripting.
Intermediate Computational modeling where students will be introduced to more complex RhinoCommon's functionalities (advanced manipulations and geometries, custom classes) to produce advanced geometric elements and operations through scripting.
This configuration in 4 modules allows to gradually increase the level of complexity and to initiate architecture students to computational thinking.
What is meant by the term "image" as pictorial representation?
How do we read, process and interpret images - and what premises can be derived from this for the conception and production of meaningful images?
Images have never been as present as they are today.
With the invention of technically produced images, the digitisation of content and the latter's increasing accessibility via digital information technologies, the image, as a medium, now shapes all facets of our social communication.
Today, images have become omnipresent, permeating all areas of life and knowledge in our society to an unprecedented extent - also in architecture.
The first theoretical part of the course provides a basic outline of the concept of the image and the nature of pictorial representation.
Important underlying aspects of visual perception are taught, and the associated blurring and scope for interpretation in the processing of visual information are demonstrated.
Following this, basic concepts of gestalt psychology or gestalt theory and important principles of image organisation are introduced and shown in more detail using example images from the fields of art, photography and cinematography.
In view of the constantly changing technical and cultural conditions, individual example images are examined with regard to their content-related, formal and aesthetic aspects, and the claim to reality asserted by newer, seemingly photographic images is questioned and discussed.
With practical work in mind, important elements of image design and visual composition are subsequently taught, along with methods for preparing, managing (curating), editing and collaging digital images.
Based on the knowledge acquired from the lecture series and aided by the practice-oriented workshops, the students individually develop a multi-part visual work during the semester.
The image technologies used comprise photography and digital montage.
70% des activités des bureaux d'architecture se déroulent dans le projet dans l'existant.
Le cours souhaite transmettre aux étudiants les outils théoriques et pratiques de base pour aborder le projet dans l'existant, sur un patrimoine bâti courant mais aussi sur celui à caractère monumental.
Le projet dans l'existant est une discipline foisonnante qui convoque des multiples savoirs et hybride rigueur scientifique et imagination prospective.
Les cultures de l'histoire et celles de la technique se croisent et se superposent dans une démarche de création qui prend appui sur un travail d'investigation sur le bâtiment et se poursuit tout au long du processus de conception.
Ce cheminement intellectuel est fondé sur la connaissance minutieuse de l'uvre construite, son observation et analyse physique, par le croisement et la synthÚse des compétences les plus diverses, tant théoriques qu'opérationnelles.
L'objectif principal du cours est de cerner cette démarche complexe.
Il s'agit tout d'abord d'expliciter les raisons culturelles et les champs d'application du projet de sauvegarde et de restauration, à l'appui de quelques notions théoriques et législatives, ainsi que par une introduction à la connaissance des outils courants d'inventaire et définition préalable de la valeur patrimoniale des bâtiments.
Cette introduction historico-critique se poursuit par la prise en compte des enjeux méthodologiques du projet de sauvegarde, de la premiÚre phase de connaissance et analyse, à l'élaboration de la stratégie du projet la plus appropriée, puis sa gestion et sa réalisation.
Ainsi, les outils essentiels du projet dans l'existant sont abordés de maniÚre systématique.
La compréhension des spécificités constructives du patrimoine bâti et leur évolution structure, matériaux, modalités de mise en uvre, etc.
, est le fil rouge de l'enseignement.
Sur la base de cette investigation matérielle approfondie les principaux thÚmes du projet dans l'existant font l'objet d'un examen ciblé.
Cela concerne notamment le diagnostic élargi de l'état de conservation y compris au niveau des désordres structurels , les diverses techniques d'intervention conservation, réparation, consolidation, etc.
, en passant par la question, cruciale, de la mise à niveau des bâtiments, voire leur adaptation en termes d'usage, sécurité, confort, économie d'énergie, etc.
Du fait de la nature même du projet de sauvegarde, largement pluridisciplinaire, des synergies avec d'autres enseignements sont prévues physique du bâtiment, relevé et techniques figuratives, structure et matériaux, etc.
De même, des apports de professionnels du domaine sont conviés, sous forme de conférence publique.
Ce cours introduit des méthodologies pour intégrer des matériaux bio/géosourcés dans la construction de bâtiments.
L'objectif pédagogique est d'amener les étudiants à acquérir des compétences dans la conception critique de bâtiments en tenant compte d'enjeux environnementales et techniques.
Ce cours et destiné à développer l'aptitude réflective et créative des étudiant.e.s sur la matérialisation d'un projet de bâtiment par l'analyse du site et du contexte, par le dessin ainsi que par des simulations numériques.
Ceci autour de trois thématiques principales :
l'évaluation et le choix de matériaux bio/géosourcés ;
la mise en place de principe bioclimatiques ainsi que la planification et organisation du chantier.
Les apports théoriques spécifiques et l'exercice d'application semestriel en plusieurs étapes forment la base de l'enseignement.
Ils sont complétés par des conférences et des visites de chantier.
TdB VI utilise des descriptions détaillées de projets de bâtiments pour examiner la relation entre l'enveloppe, la structure et les conditions environnementales internes, avec pour toile de fond la production et la consommation de ressources lors la transformation/rénovation de bâtiments.
TdB VI est l'application synthétique des connaissances développées dans TdB V.
Le semestre est organisé autour d'exercice sur l'enveloppe des bâtiments, qui mettent en évidence la synergie entre les quatre dimensions de l'environnement, des matériaux, des structures et de la construction.
Durant le semestre, les étudiants seront exposés à de multiples études de cas de façades de bâtiments et à une série de conférences concernant leurs principes de fonctionnement et leurs critères de fabrication.
Les connaissances acquises seront appliquées à la conception technique d'une façade pour un bâtiment.
Ces projets prendront la forme de dessins de détails, de graphiques et d'écrits, et seront évalués sous la forme de contrôles continus.
This theory course considers the building as a material thing, focusing on the process and matter of architecture to examine how buildings come into being and stay (or don't) in place:

The course introduces the most important periods of European and international garden history and design up to the present day and shows the importance of public parks and green spaces for modern urban development.
Students are given the opportunity to analyze and interpret their own example.
From the medieval garden to the gardens of the Renaissance and Mannerism, the Baroque, the English garden and eclectic gardens through to contemporary trends, the most important periods in the development of the European garden are presented.
At the same time, the focus is broadened to include important international trends in historical garden design such as Persian and Islamic gardens as well as Chinese and Japanese gardens.
The typical characteristics of the respective epoch are worked out and at the same time outstanding individual gardens are analysed as paradigms of their type.
Furthermore, issues and challenges facing the management of historic parks and gardens in today's urban planning are highlighted.
The aim is to understand that gardens are not just collections of plants, but can also express social status and power relations, reflect views of nature and different relationships between the 'inside' and 'outside' of the associated buildings, and that they represent dialogues between nature and culture.
The different types of gardens not only form aesthetic units, but are also part of a broader socio-political context.
The design of each garden reflects the philosophical approach of its creator and, in a broader sense, is also embedded in the respective social context.
The reflection of social conditions and the development of social visions also applies in particular to the public parks created from the 19th century onwards, which became essential elements of urban development.
In addition, some park types were motors for the development of ideas for the socialisation of urban vegetation and new models for living together in the city.
The course aims to teach students that today's gardens and parks are also part of a historical tradition, while developing their own unique characteristics in response to social and environmental challenges.
Le cours de Théorie de l'Urbanisme traite des modèles, projets et techniques de l'urbanisme entre XIXe et XXIe siècle, en mettant en relation discours théorique et projet, texte et image.
Le projet d'urbanisme est le champ d'expérimentation de concepts sous la forme de thèmes spatiaux.
Le vaste domaine de l'urbanisme s'est progressivement configuré à la confluence de disciplines et savoir-faire variés, tels que l'architecture, la médecine, l'économie, le droit ou lécologie, avec pour enjeu celui de créer les conditions d'un transfert entre imaginaires sociaux, ressources spatiales et ressources matérielles.
Dans ce transfert, les concepts de ville/artefact/nature s'en trouvent constamment réinterprétés, pris dans différentes déclinaisons des thèmes spatiaux de:
centre/périphérie, ordre, hiérarchie/absence de hiérarchie, partie/ensemble, continuité/discontinuité.
Le passage de la ville moderne à la ville contemporaine, en arrivant jusqu'aux défis de la nouvelle transition urbaine, fixe les cordonnées historiques de la matière du semestre.
En traitant de modèles, projets, techniques et outils de l'urbanisme, le cours permettra d'identifier différentes approches fondamentales, reconnaissables au fil du temps.
Nous nous concentrerons notamment sur la dialectique entre, d'une part, la conception de la ville comme fait construit, entité spatiale finie et limitée, et, d'autre part, la ville-territoire, structurée par l'espace ouvert et aux limites indéterminées.
A l'ère de la transition, la dialectique entre ville limitée et ville-territoire prend une nouvelle tonalité.
Les différentes objectifs de l'émancipation sociale, de la maîtrise quantitative ou de la réparation des inégalités, qui avaient caractérisé l'urbanisme de l'ère industrielle, n'ont pas perdu de pertinence, mais acquièrent des nouvelles significations et des nouvelles formes.
Ce cours étudie douze positions théoriques pour une architecture à l'ère de l'accélération.
En inscrivant ces positions dans l'histoire récente de l'architecture et en les replaçant dans le contexte actuel, il vise à saisir la pertinence de ces positions pour la pratique contemporaine.
Ce cours considère les défis systémiques des crises actuelles comme point de départ d'une réflexion théorique quant à la conception architecturale.
Au lieu de chercher des réponses en dehors de la discipline, ce cours propose de rester aussi proche que possible de l'architecture elle-même.
En d'autres termes, l'un des points sous-jacents de ce cours est la conviction que la discipline de l'architecture offre un riche champ de savoirs quant aux enjeux actuels.
Le cours étudie douze positions théoriques :
acceleration, écologie, contradiction, mémoire, technologie, le commun, populisme, participation, adhocism, régionalisme critique, transformation, et résilience.
Chacun des cours s'articule autour d'une position, d'une figure clé, d'un texte qui fait office de source primaire.
Ainsi, chaque position est liée à un contexte politique et social dans lequel les architectes ont contesté, contredit, ou exploré des alternatives à leurs rôles, leurs outils, leurs méthodes.
L'analyse des positions, la lecture des textes et la contextualisation des protagonistes invite les étudiants à se pencher sur la période postmoderne, une période de crises et de remises en question, ainsi que de conscience environnementale croissante.
Si ces positions sont apparues comme des alternatives à une architecture de l'accélération, peuvent-elles être relues à la lumière des défis posés à la pratique architecturale aujourd'hui ?
Ces positions pourraient-elles être traduites, nuancées, approfondies afin de formuler des approches singulières face à a transition écologique et sociale ?
Ce cours invite les étudiants à saisir les continuités historiques ainsi que les moments de ruptures et d'en déceler des perspectives pour une pratique engagée à l'ère de l'accélération.
Is it conceivable to question the very presence of highways in urban environments?
What potential for requalification does this space, with its unique characteristics, offer?
This is the central question that the Design Studio will explore during the spring semester, producing "counter-projects" aimed at overcoming, dismantling, adapting, repurposing, and reconceptualizing the highway barriers still present within the city.
Several Swiss cities are intersected by stretches of the national road network, remnants of a bygone era.
Today, these roads act as barriers to urban movement, sources of air and noise pollution, and spaces of congestion, as the massive traffic volumes they channel into the city are excessive.
The first step is to identify and map these areas;
the second is to develop hypotheses about their potential evolution.
Drawing on existing research, site visits, and project development, the Design Studio will generate ideas and perspectives to be debated collectively and publicly.
*** Celle-ci est l'interrogation que l'Atelier développera dans le semestre de printemps qui produira des « contre-projets » urbains de dépassement, démantèlement, adaptation, réutilisation, reconceptualisation des barreaux autoroutiers encore présents dans la ville.
Plusieurs villes suisses sont traversées par des tronçons du réseau des routes nationales helvétiques qui appartiennent à une époque dévolue :
ils agissent, aujourd'hui, comme des barrières aux mouvements de la ville, des pollueurs de l'air et acoustique, des espaces congestionnés car les grands volumes de trafic qu'ils amènent en ville est excessif.
Il s'agit d'abord de les repérer, de les cartographier et, deuxième, de développer des hypothèses de leur évolution.
A partir de recherches déjà développées, de visites des sites et de la construction de projets, l'Atelier fournira des idées et des points de vue à débattre collectivement et publiquement.
La maison comme une ville - Les grandes maisonnées continues.
Voyage d'étude - Zurich:
4 au 6 octobre 2025 LA MAISON COMME UNE VILLE LES GRANDES MAISONÉES CONTINUES DOMESTIC CITY-LAB (DC-LAB) STUDIO SOPHIE DELHAY assistée par Harry Waknine & Melchior Dechancé UNE THEME, L'HABITAT Constituant près de 80 % du grain de la ville, l'habitat est un levier décisif pour encourager les relations sociales, de soin, tout en réduisant nos besoins en ressources et en énergie, afin de faire évoluer la ville et le logement dans un même mouvement.
Travailler sur l'habitat, c'est trouver les formes pour rendre possible un monde plus juste d'un point de vue social, spatial, dans une écologie des rapports humains.
Le studio voit l'habitat comme le point de départ d'une architecture qui met au centre une vie intimement collective et solidaire, et qui explore des territoires à partir de leur caractère domestique.
Espaces et Usages:
L'habitat rend compte de dimensions spatiales, sociales et environnementales.
Ses dimensions spatiales sont proprement liées à la discipline architecturale (à la composition de plan, aux qualités constructives, matérielles, atmosphériques) ;
ses dimensions sociales sont liées aux modes de vie et aux usages ;
ses dimensions environnementales sont liées à ses besoins d'économie d'espace, de moyens, de matière et d'énergie.
Nous pensons l'habitat comme un principe émancipatoire capable, à l'aune des crises sociales et climatiques qui nous traversent, de révolutionner nos villes depuis l'intérieur.
L'habitat est un outil puissant pour concevoir une ville et une société plus justes, plus durables, vertueuses et hédonistes.
Territoires intimes:
Le studio situe l'habitat dans un spectre plus vaste que celui du logement.
L'habitat est un espace tendu entre la petite et la grande échelle :
entre le mobilier et le territoire, l'échelle domestique et l'échelle urbaine, le corps et la ville, le temps court des gestes quotidiens et le temps long des vies qui s'y succèdent.
L'habitat est aussi le lieu où s'entremêlent des usages ordinaires et extraordinaires, des aspects fonctionnels et poétiques, des habitudes et des surprises.
L'habitat est donc à la fois rationnel et poétique, concret et abstrait, immanent et ontologique, fondé sur notre capacité à se projeter, à rêver demain, et à être fondés par notre mémoire et nos désirs.
En bref, l'habitat établit avant tout des rapports, des articulations, et met en perspective des opposés, des notions a priori contradictoires ou habituellement dissociées.
L'habitat est le lieu du lien.
UN OUTIL, LA CUISINE La cuisine est prise comme point de départ des deux semestres.
Tout comme l'architecture, la cuisine est à la fois un espace (une pièce), un usage (le repas), un temps (un rituel), mais aussi un besoin vital (où l'on pourvoit à la subsistance) et un fait culturel (la gastronomie).
C'est aussi une discipline vernaculaire et exploratoire - locale et globale - entre cuisine traditionnelle et nouvelle cuisine.
Nous proposons d'interpréter et d'analyser l'espace de la cuisine sous quatre angles :
- En tant qu'espace social :
lieu où se déroule la commensalité, mais aussi espace approprié par ses habitants à travers la pratique incarnée de la préparation du repas.
- En tant qu'espace politique, révélateur des relations de pouvoir liées au travail productif et reproductif.
Il est aussi l'espace du logement le plus genré.
- En tant qu'espace hédoniste, où la gastronomie et la technique s'allient pour que la subsistance se transforme en plaisir partagé.
- En tant qu'espace climatique, équipé d'une alimentation en eau, d'appareils de cuisson, de réfrigérateurs et d'extracteurs d'air, elle pourrait jouer un rôle important dans le bien-être climatique de l'habitation, comme c'était le cas avant l'ère industrielle.
Pour toutes ces raisons, la cuisine est un outil puissant pour transformer politiquement, socialement et climatiquement la production standardisée de l'habitat.
La cuisine est aussi le lieu des sens et des plaisirs, et peut stimuler une architecture plus hédoniste.
1 RECHERCHE, 2 SEMESTRES Nous vous proposons d'explorer deux scénarios où les distinctions entre intérieur et extérieur, petite dimension et grande dimension, habituellement dévolues d'un côté au logement, de l'autre à la ville, seraient recomposées différemment.
Il s'agirait ici d'une même chose :
l'habitat.
Dans cet esprit, on vivrait la maison comme une ville et la ville comme une maison.
LA MAISON COMME UNE VILLE LES GRANDES MAISONÉES CONTINUES Ce semestre d'automne, le studio s'attachera à l'exploration de la typologie de la nappe, c'est-à-dire au logement de faible hauteur mais de haute densité.
Les ressorts de cette typologie n'ont été que peu exploités par le passé.
Le studio part du postulat que la transformation d'ouvrages étals (tels que des hangars ou des usines) en nappe permettrait l'essor d'une typologie qui associe de manière intense les deux caractères ambivalents de l'habitat:
vivre seul et ensemble, c'est-à-dire individuellement et collectivement.
D'un côté, la nappe promet un habitat dont les qualités mêlent indépendance, générosité des espaces extérieurs et variété typologique, et nous rechercherons comment ses multiples mitoyennetés peuvent, au contraire, favoriser des continuités et rendre possible une vie sociale plus collective et plus intense.
C'est ce que nous appellerons les grandes maisonnées continues.
De l'autre, cette typologie trouve en construction neuve ses limites en termes de faible compacité, développement proliférant et forte emprise au sol, qui en font un type dispendieux d'un point de vue écologique.
Nous rechercherons comment la typologie de la nappe, dans le cadre de la transformation, peut répondre à cet enjeu.
Dans l'ensemble, nous rechercherons comment les grandes maisonnées continues permettent d'établir une écologie des rapports humains.
Cuisines:
Le semestre débute par l'analyse d'un corpus de références de cuisines issues d'horizons géographiques et d'époques variés.
Ces analyses mettent en lumière la capacité de cette pièce à créer du lien entre habitant·e·x·s ou à réguler les climats dans l'espace domestique.
Des projets en transformation:
Concrètement, il s'agira de concevoir, par groupes de trois, une grande maisonnée (soit une nappe abritant plus de 100 personnes) continue en réutilisant un hangar existant à Lausanne.
Souvent destinés à être démolis et remplacés par des modèles de logements standardisés, les hangars nous offrent de nouvelles opportunités spatiales et domestiques.
À travers leur épaisseur typologique, leur générosité et répétitivité structurelle, leur transformation en grandes maisonnées continues stimule une conception de l'habitat qui s'éloigne des standards désormais révolus.
Des modes de vie contemporains:
Face aux bouleversements du foyer contemporain, les grandes maisonnées continues proposeront de nouvelles formes d'hospitalité pour faire coexister toutes les générations.
Les cuisines tisseront les liens entre habitant·e·x·s et organiseront la manière dont les ressources sociales et climatiques sont collectivement gérées et partagées.
Greenhouse Studies explore le potentiel des structures de serres dans le contexte des défis contemporains.
Les ateliers de projet étudient les serres comme un type architectural sensible au climat, capable de transformer des structures existantes en espaces collectifs et communautaires.
GREENHOUSE STUDIES II 'Clothing as an extension of our skin helps to store and to channel energy, ...If clothing is an extension of our private skins to store and channel our own heat and energy, housing is a collective means of achieving the same end for the family or the group.
Housing as shelter is an extension of our bodily heat-control mechanisms - a collective skin or garment.' Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media:
The Extensions of Man (Cambridge:
MIT Press, 1911) Following a first design studio on greenhouses, Laboratory EAST presents Greenhouse Studies II - The collective (Fall semester), and Greenhouse studies III - The common (Spring semester), the laboratory's second and third interaction with a unique element in the history of architecture.
The studio is interested in the multiple uses of greenhouse spaces outside the horticultural context.
In Greenhouse Studies I, the design studio took a cross-sectional look at domestic greenhouses as a space for expanding the individual home.
The greenhouse served as garden for vegetables, as passive heating device, or extra living room.
Through superposition, juxtaposition, or all-over solutions, the greenhouse spatial structure constituted a new thermal buffer zone that interacted differently with the existing volumes.
In Greenhouse Studies II and III, the studio will continue the survey, aware of new dimensions:
from the individual to the collective, from the collective to the common, from the small villa scale to the collective housing, from collective housing to common programs.
Together we will build on these concepts while exploring greenhouse-like solutions.
What are the implications of such change?
The results will contribute to an open-source, collaborative database that will grow each semester.
Type and Typology as framework Typology is recognised as a fundamental concept for a better understanding of architecture and its history.
It serves as a basic framework, a kind of tacit backbone for the organisation of architectural knowledge and can also be a tool for generating new architectural solutions.
Some argue that typology is as old as architecture itself, as it involves the reproduction of dominant types and models that are deeply rooted in socio-cultural realities.
Alternatively, it can be said that architecture responds to new social and economic needs by inventing or revising existing types.
Typology and types traditionally interact with the formal dimension (buildings organised by a common form or element) and the functional dimension (buildings organised by a common function).
However, this focus has often overlooked other, less tangible possibilities, such as structural relationships between types and climate in architecture.
Climatic Type as central theme Conservatories, greenhouses, glasshouses, forcing houses, hothouses, invernaderos in Spanish, orangeries, jardins d' hiver or serres in French - many are the terms associated with the idea of housing plants.
All of these artefacts have a common goal:
to create a climate adapted to plant life.
Although greenhouses were conceived with a very precise objective, this climatic space quickly became an exhibition space, a social space, and even a space for celebrations before it fell into disuse.
In the second half of the 20th century, greenhouse-based solutions made a comeback, fostering solar architecture and reinforcing the foundations of bioclimatic architecture in western societies.
During this time, horticulture continued developing greenhouses as productive spaces, and innovations led to intensive fields of production.
In absolute terms, it is not the form or function that characterizes the greenhouse but the definition of a space with specific climatic conditions.
In most cases, using wood or metal structures and transparent materials such as glass, these structures keep a very low ratio between the material used and the enclosed space, offering the most with the least.
The characterization of the greenhouse as an artefact of a climatic nature suggests that the greenhouse as a type does not depend on scale or size.
Since its inception, the multiform and multifunctional greenhouse space has been transformed into a social space with very specific microclimatic characteristics.
The collective 'The luxury of unused space!
This was also an attempt to test an idea.
The space changes independently.
Rooms change in space through the growing and dying of plants.
It should be attractive for the interior designer to experience such autonomous spatial changes.' In LOG ID (ed.), Gruene Archen-Harmonie mit Pflanzen leben das Modell der Gruppe LOG ID (Frankfurt am Main:
Fricke Verlag, 1983) Unfolding over the course of two semesters, both design studios will explore the dynamics between greenhouses, greenhouse components or greenhouse functions and existing building structures as architectural forms, climatic spaces and temporary uses of space:
Greenhouse Studies II The collective, the design studio will focus on the renovation of collective residential architecture in the Romandie.
When renovating existing monotonous buildings from the construction boom of the 1970s, the potential for conversion is overlaid with the climate aspect of the greenhouse.
The goal is to renovate the building, enhance its existing features, explore scenarios of densification, expand existing programmes or introduce new ones, enrich living comfort, and consider passive heating and cooling solutions.
The design should prioritise the collective dimension, and wherever possible, test greenhouse-like solutions by focusing on concepts such as seasonal living, microclimatic diversity, and synergy of living spaces.
Extending the building's lifespan involves considering materials, as well as exploring typological structures capable of accommodating change and a range of use cases.
The development of both phases will be undertaken in groups consisting of two or three students, and a Seminar Day will comprise a series of multidisciplinary theoretical contributions from external experts.
We will investigate the possible interactions between two different architectural spaces, and gain a better understanding of the typological transfers and climatic synergies between them.
Greenhouse-like structures offer the opportunity to investigate prefabricated systems, test designs for deconstruction and reversibility in design thinking, and ultimately find a 'lighter' way to redesign existing buildings.
By looking at greenhouses as specific built environments, the studio will formulate solutions based on the concept of architecture as atmosphere, while exploring its transformative potential.
In addition, the studio will examine greenhouses as climate-responsive artefacts, exploring how seasons can change spaces, or, in other words, what it means to inhabit spaces seasonally.
If we change clothes according to the seasons, should our buildings change too?
Practicalities Each semester will be composed of two parts.
The first part - Research on precedents - will be developed individually to expand the corpus of references and help us learn from existing buildings.
The studio will collectively build a visual atlas made of peculiar, strange or remarkable case-studies.
The design study will analyse the characteristics of the case studies, like:
flexible use of space, evaluate their thermal behaviour throughout the seasons, formmaking aspects, thermical airflow and mechanics of openings.
The key findings from this body of references will inform the design phase.
In the second part - Design Studio - participants will develop their own design in groups of two or three.
Learning outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to:
Apply and present research capable to inform a design project Analyse and interpret critically an architectural work Formulate a problem and provide design-based solution Represent accurately a design proposal with drawings and models at multiple scales Develop a narrative and present arguments to specialised and non-specialised audiences Develop awareness about the implicit and explicit messages of an architectural project Work collaboratively and integrate knowledge from different disciplines
"To be useful, helpful, of assistance to someone:" The "In Service of:
Berre" studio reflects on the architectural and territorial project as a form of public service.
It explores how architecture and design tools can engage in spatial struggles in the context of toxic, petrochemical territories.
L'atelier consiste en une mise en situation de projet dans l'existant, à a fois concrète et prospective.
Celle-ci s'étend du diagnostic à la réhabilitation, en passant par la reprogrammation.
La halle Tapponnier, construite à Annemasse en 1929 selon un procédé Hennebique, est notre objet d'étude.
Le déjà-là La halle Tapponnier a été construite en 1929 à destination d'un quai à marchandises en gare d'Annemasse.
L'entreprise Hennebique en a été chargée de la conception.
Fondée par François B.
Hennebique (1842-1921), l'entreprise est pionnière dans la généralisation progressive du recours au béton armé dans la construction, d'abord d'ouvrages d'art puis d'immeubles d'habitation, au tournant du XXe siècle.
C'est donc tout naturellement que la halle Tapponnier a été construite exclusivement en béton armé.
Les fermes de sa charpente, caractéristiques du procédé Hennebique, permettent de dégager ses plus de 1.000 m² de tout élément porteur à l'intérieur.
Particulièrement performante au regard de son usage initial, au profit des transports Tapponnier (auxquels elle doit son nom mais aujourd'hui disparus), la halle Tapponnier peine, depuis la fin du XXe siècle, à s'adapter à un nouvel usage.
De fait, malgré le caractère remarquable de son architecture, l'intérêt de son emplacement et l'ampleur de son volume capable, en l'absence de projet de réactivation, son état se détériore et mène à sa ruine progressive.
Une situation urbaine complexe Dès l'origine, la halle Tapponnier participe d'une situation urbaine particulièrement riche autour des voies de chemin de fer qui traversent et desservent la Ville d'Annemasse.
Composé de la halle, d'une gare (construite par Maurice Braillard, arch., en 1932 ;
aujourd'hui largement remaniée) et d'une imposante rotonde ferroviaire (aujourd'hui démolie), ce site est aujourd'hui difficilement lisible dans sa configuration historique.
Il a en effet connu de nombreuses évolutions tout au long du XXe siècle et en ce premier quart du XXIe siècle, en parallèle du développement exponentiel de la ligne Annemasse-Genève.
La dernière en date (2017-2020) a notamment vu la création d'un bâtiment voyageurs, intégrant littéralement la gare historique et jouxtant la halle Tapponnier.
Plus largement, l'ensemble du quartier de la gare est aujourd'hui fondu dans le projet de l'« écoquartier de l'Étoile ».
La réhabilitation de la halle Tapponnier, bien qu'intégrée au périmètre de cet aménagement, ainsi que celle du terrain vague la prolongeant, n'est toujours pas entamée.
Le potentiel du patrimoine La mise au jour du potentiel d'un bâti existant, qu'il soit protégé ou ordinaire, implique son étude préalable.
À travers celle de la halle Tapponnier, il s'agit de s'approprier les méthodes et les outils spécifiques de l'étude patrimoniale.
Leur maîtrise, à laquelle tend à initier cette première séquence, participe d'une meilleure compréhension de ce qui est déjà là, en vue d'une intervention.
Il s'agit également de prendre conscience que cette étude constitue une part intégrante du projet et pas seulement une phase liminaire, dépourvue d'intentions conceptuelles.
L'étude patrimoniale intègre le relevé de l'existant sur site, son étude historique et sa critique d'authenticité à partir des archives ainsi que son diagnostic technique et sanitaire.
La mener à bien suppose d'adopter une démarche pluridisciplinaire en impliquant des spécialistes tels que des ingénieurs, des entreprises et des chercheurs.
Cette phase d'étude constitue également une opportunité de s'interroger sur les modes de représentation de l'architecture et du paysage.
Par ailleurs, il est important de rappeler que l'ensemble de ces méthodes et outils ne constitue pas seulement un corpus figé de procédés expérimentés mais bien un champ de recherche contemporain, expérimental et continu.
Restaurer, transformer, créer Seule une réactivation par l'usage peut assurer la pérennité de l'existant et en l'occurrence celle de la halle Tapponnier.
La reprogrammation constitue à ce titre une phase de réflexion préalable et indispensable à la réhabilitation.
Viennent ensuite les différents types d'intervention dans l'existant, de la restauration à la création, en passant par la transformation.
Ces derniers ne doivent pas être déterminés a priori mais résulter des conclusions de l'étude patrimoniale, en particulier de celles relatives à la valeur patrimoniale des éléments constitutifs de la halle Tapponnier.
Le potentiel de celle-ci ne se révèlera concrètement qu'à travers ces interventions.
Pour servir au présent, l'existant peut ainsi nécessiter une restauration, totale ou partielle, impliquer une transformation d'une de ses parties, voire exiger une création, sous la forme d'une extension par exemple.
De plus, au-delà du type d'intervention, se pose la question du parti pris.
En effet, chacun de ces types se décline pour participer au mieux à un projet cohérent.
Ces interventions doivent être contextualisées (c'est-à-dire définies par rapport au site, aux matériaux, aux mises en œuvre, etc.) et inscrites parmi celles de nombreux partenaires (ingénieurs et entreprises spécialisés).
Bioclimatisme et enjeux contemporains L'intervention dans l'existant est une pratique ancienne bien que résolument contemporaine, en phase avec les enjeux écologiques et sociaux d'aujourd'hui.
L'obsolescence fonctionnelle de la halle Tapponnier constitue, à ce titre, un cas d'école.
Elle attire notre attention sur la capacité d'adaptation de ce qui est déjà là et de ce que nous construisons.
Cette adaptabilité s'entend bien sûr sur le plan des usages mais également sur ceux de l'environnement et du confort, notamment face au dérèglement climatique.
Ainsi, la réactivation de cette halle en béton nécessite de l'appréhender au prisme d'une conception bioclimatique.
En phase d'étude, cela signifie d'en identifier les faiblesses thermiques, hygrométriques et acoustiques mais aussi les potentialités d'éclairage et de ventilation naturels.
En phase de projet, il ne s'agit donc pas de mettre en œuvre des solutions ex nihilo mais davantage d'optimiser l'isolation, de valoriser les apports solaires ou encore d'améliorer la ventilation naturelle.
Pour ce faire et poursuivre un objectif d'une moindre empreinte carbone, on peut privilégier le recours à la végétation, l'utilisation de matériaux biosourcés ou encore le remploi de matériaux.
Loin de nous décourager, ces enjeux doivent donc nous responsabiliser et nous pousser à agir en nous saisissant, par exemple, du patrimoine comme d'une ressource et un point d'appui générateur de projet.
Typological Urbanism bridges architecture and urbanism through dual perspectives:
architectural typologies shaping urban form from within, and urban types shaping it from without.
Working across scales, the studio explores evolving Swiss urban contexts through ensemble and composite forms.
Architecture versus Urbanism The term Typological Urbanism refers to a design method situated at the overlap of architecture and urbanism.
In our understanding, urbanism is neither the outcome of engineered masterplans - where form is determined and filled with program - nor the product of a loose collection of autonomous architectural objects.
Instead, we believe in a strong interdependency between architecture and urbanism.
We recognize a conceptual gap in practice between these two disciplines.
Typological Urbanism allows us to respond with precision to the multiple dimensions of the urban condition - context, program, and existing fabric - without relying on idealistic projections.
Instead, it operates through inherent rules:
robust yet flexible enough to be reassembled in every moment.
This assemblage relies in a fluent state, like the work of Imi Knoebel it can feel assembled and disassembled at the same time.
This ambiguity and open-endedness enable appropriation and identification.
A Dual Approach Typological Urbanism can be approached from two complementary directions:
From within:
architectural typologies (such as housing) generate spatial organization and in turn shape urban form.
From without:
predefined or emergent urban types constitute our built environment, including aspects such as open space, program, ownership, and accessibility.
This duality reflects the legacy of modernist thought - its search for rationality - and its postmodern revision, which reintroduced context, memory, and multiplicity into design.
Synthesizing these principles enables us to resist both dogmatism and nostalgia.
Working Across Scales This duality is not contradictory;
on the contrary, it becomes our design method.
To investigate it, we will work simultaneously on two scales:
the individual unit and the urban figure.
By studying how these two levels interact, we aim to reveal deeper spatial relationships.
Our starting point will be specific housing typologies, through which we will analyse spatial logics and organizational principles.
From there, we will scale outward - investigating how abstract volumes relate to one another within a larger spatial composition.
The central question becomes:
can the relationships and conditions identified at the architectural scale be translated into, or discovered within, the urban dimension?
Sites of Urban Reassembly In the Swiss context, urban development is no longer driven by expansion into open land, but by the densification and transformation of existing environments.
Within these already-defined boundaries, most areas transitioning from industrial or infrastructural uses to residential, commercial, services or public functions have now been developed.
Yet some questions remain.
Our investigations extend beyond these specific zones and apply equally to the mixed-use city, to urban areas growing across municipal lines, to agglomerations evolving into coherent urban forms, and to housing settlements striving for greater density and urban character.
Urban Ensemble or Urban Composite Over the course of the academic year, each semester will prioritize one aspect of this duality within a design project:
Semester 1:
The Urban Ensemble (Zurich):
Focused on how urban form emerges from the interaction of typologies in a loose arrangement of buildings.
Semester 2:
The Urban Composite (Lausanne):
Investigates the idea of a hybrid building - a type in itself that incorporates multiple typologies.
Challenging outdated zoning laws, we will apply a consistent programmatic set in each context - a mix of uses tailored to local conditions, yet designed to ensure that a piece of city can emerge and evolve.

It's about space!
The spaces are small, following one another in rapid sequences, shifting direction, light, views, form, furniture, and use.
This is living.
A rich spatial experience that goes far beyond fulfilling functional requirements and measurable parameters.
Over the course of two semesters, we explore the spatial potential of housing on an individual site.
The goal is to create generous and versatile spaces within a small area.
A way to respond to limited resources through spatial strategies.
We experiment with parametric tools to transform familiar rooms and apartments, explore variations, refine spatial relationships, discover geometric possibilities, and define architectural principles.
Simultaneously we are using analog spatial techniques, to analyse, develop, and present the projects.

The course explores how minimal architectural interventions can have a lasting impact through sensitivity to context, community, and place.
Using Aurigeno in Valle Maggia as a case study, students develop proposals rooted in observation, care, and territorial acupuncture.
How can architecture have an impact without being imposing?
Through precise observation, careful approach, and a profound engagement with each specific place, it becomes possible to create architectonical gestures that are reduced to the absolute essentials.
It is about the smallest possible intervention - stripped down to its essence - that conserves resources yet remains powerful.
Such an approach responds to the site itself, to its existing traces and potentials, and to the needs of its inhabitants.
This requires close attention and listening, as well as an understanding of the context as a built reality, in all its spatial, social, and cultural facets.
At the core lies an attitude of care:
only those who engage intensively with the local conditions and the needs of the inhabitants can develop interventions that achieve broad social acceptance and endure over time.
Such an approach can strengthen the resilience of a place.
When future users see themselves reflected in the built environment, when the architectural intervention embeds itself in the layers of collective memory, architecture becomes part of the common ground.
This generates care - concern, responsibility, and identification - from the inhabitants, who embrace the new addition, which in turn contributes to the project's longevity.
Thus, the much-discussed notion of sustainability in architecture today is not only ecological, material, or economic;
it must also address the social and cultural rootedness of the intervention within its context.
It questions how architects can listen attentively and plan with precision projects that achieve great impact through territorial acupuncture.
This semester, we will focus on the village of Aurigeno in the Valle Maggia in Ticino.
It is a picturesque village facing the same challenges as many others:
a shrinking and aging population.
Consequently, public space, as an extension of the domestic sphere, becomes an even more crucial setting for social interaction.
We will engage deeply with Aurigeno - its residents, its history, its built fabric - in order to imagine together where these interactions could take place.
At the same time, we will analyze the broader territorial scale and observe the smallest given details.
We will investigate where potential for encounters already exists - often as missed opportunities - which we can reinterpret and transform into shared spaces that foster social exchange through territorial acupuncture.
During the semester, a lecture series featuring experts from various disciplines will offer diverse perspectives on the role of public space across time, society, and spatial coexistence.
The studio in the fall semester will be primarily led by Rina Rolli, with the assistance of Blerta Axhija.
Successional Dwellings:
An experimental semester, based on the concept of 'succession'.
Building and inhabiting as a continuous process, that never comes to an end.
SUCCESSIONAL DWELLINGS This is going to be an experimental semester, based on the concept of 'succession'.
Succession is an ecological term describing the sequence in which plant and animal communities replace one another over time at a given site.
We adopt this concept to re-imagine building and inhabiting as a form of succession:
every moment in a building's life hosts a particular community of inhabitants, only to be succeeded by others.
1 DisturbancesA successional sequence usually begins with a disturbance - wether storm, wildfire, clearance or sealing of the soil.
However devastating such damage may be, it also opens space for pioneer organisms and, in turn, for the many follow-on communities they invite.
In the studio we will build our houses on plots in Lausanne that have also been disturbed:
by rockfalls, landfilling or dioxin pollution.
Carefully studying these sites, with all their visible and invisible histories, will be an important first step for us.
2 PioneersDirectly afterwards we will start to build on those disturbed sites.
Just as pioneer plants put down roots in disturbed ground, we start with the foundations of a house, asking, for example, whether screw piles or rubble-stone footings can become part of a larger root system.
We test these questions in pairs at large working models that evolve throughout the semester.
3 Passing-onNow - after a few weeks in the studio - something unusual will happen:
we pass on our project to another group and receive a project in return.
Yes!
We as architects will become successorsthroughout the whole semester, several times.
That makes us aware that everything we create will be subject to change at some point in the future - but also that this is a joyful way of working collectively in the studio.
One might think this could be the end of authorship in architecture.
Actually, it is the opposite:
a condensation of multiple authorships, merged in constantly growing projects.
We will not have traditional crits or presentattions.
Instead, we will hold four handovers, in which groups collectively hand over and take over.
4 StratificationBeing constantly passed around through the studio, our houses grow denser and denser.
Although always under construction, they are inhabited.
We record this simultaneous building and dwelling through photographs of our large models and additional drawings.
To capture all scales, we will combine 1:1 to 1:1,000 in a single model.
Daring!
Over time we learn which materials can grow along with the house and how to steer them in a gardener's manner.
We delight in wandering components and puzzle over invasive elements;
we test which materials can serve as a solid wall for one season before migrating to another part of the project.
5 RolesIf buildings are constantly evolving like organisms, the question arises as to who will take on these ongoing construction tasks.
Can those who live in the buildings also build walls, lay bricks and move doors themselves?
On a study trip to Leipzig (Germany), we will immerse ourselves in the world of self-build for a long weekend.
We will lend a hand in a non-profit building project and learn about guided self-build strategies that go beyond the cliche of DIY.
The practical experience will help us develop alternative forms of building and living for our studio projects.
6 ClearingMid-semester our houses reach a stage of maximum density and diversity.
Now we learn how important it is to thin, prune and clear - creating space for yet further communities and thus keeping the process of succession alive.
We discover the productive power of selective felling, so different from demolition or destruction.
7 CompostTowards the end of the semester we will increasingly work with the leftovers - the cuttings from our previous actions.
We try not to throw anything away, but to make it productive on the spot:
as new building materials for alternative forms of living.
We are delighted with those materials that can simply be reused or composted, and we also look for solutions for materials already in the world that we would prefer to see disappear because of their toxicity.
8 CollectionBy term's end we stand before large models that have passed through many successive states, gone through many hands, and been captured in series of images and drawings.
It is this evolving process - with all its interim conditions - that interests us far more than any final, fixed stage.
We will spend the last few weeks finishing the documentation of this process:
together, we will distil the most intriguing moments and insights from the previous phases and transformations.
We will record these in the form of a cross-project, illustrated glossary.
The final step will be a joint review of all successions.
9 Studio environmentThe studio is aimed at students who are open to experimental teaching and working formats.
Students generally work in groups of two.
However, each group also works with the other groups by passing on work stages several times during the semester.
Projects are rotated and developed by many students in successions - a continuous process of transformation.
Students should therefore have a particular interest in collaborative working methods.
A particular focus of teaching is on very practical, material-related construction techniques for experimental forms of living.
In the studio, we work with large models that show scales from 1:1 to 1:1,000.
The semester is accompanied by guest lectures from external contributors on topics such as process-oriented construction, self-build techniques and material cycles.

Le studio Weinand adopte une approche de conception axée sur l'expérimentation des matériaux et le prototypage, en se concentrant sur le bois, les herbes et la terre.
À l'IBOIS, une riche expérience guide l'exploration de prototypes reliant concepts architecturaux et réalité construite.
Du prototype au bâtiment L'IBOIS met l'accent sur des approches de conception guidées par les matériaux.
L'année dernière, ils ont introduit la Structure en plaques de bois à fixation intégrale (IATPS), qui relie directement la conception numérique au processus de fabrication.
Les technologies numériques ont transformé le rôle de l'architecte, désormais aussi celui d'un fabricant.
L'objectif est de trouver les usages optimaux pour des matériaux spécifiques et des comportements structurels précis.
Ces outils numériques réduisent également les coûts de communication tout au long du processus de conception.
Aujourd'hui, les prototypes offrent un moyen de communication efficace entre l'homme et la machine, et peuvent être produits à moindre coût grâce à la fabrication numérique.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'un prototype?
En architecture, un prototype est une maquette à l'échelle réelle ou réduite, utilisée pour tester, affiner et explorer un projet avant la construction.
Il comble l'écart entre les idées abstraites et leur mise en œuvre physique, en révélant les qualités spatiales, les performances matérielles, les méthodes de construction et l'interaction avec l'utilisateur.
Contrairement aux modèles virtuels, les prototypes physiques permettent un engagement direct et facilitent l'évaluation de la viabilité réelle d'un projet.
Les prototypes architecturaux ont toujours servi d'outils d'expérimentation - des modèles en plâtre complexes de Gaudí aux constructions à l'échelle 1:1 comme la Khudi Bari au Bangladesh.
Qu'ils soient utilisés pour répondre à des conditions environnementales, à des défis constructifs ou à des besoins communautaires, les prototypes permettent aux architectes de tester des concepts radicaux tout en minimisant les risques.
En particulier dans les contextes à faibles ressources, le prototypage associe crèativité et nécessité, aboutissant à des structures innovantes et adaptatives, ancrées dans des conditions réelles.
En s'appuyant sur les recherches passées en matière de prototypage et de matériaux, le Studio Weinand organise une série d'ateliers centrés sur la fabrication numérique, complétés par des visites de sites afin d'observer directement l'application des matériaux et les contextes constructifs.
Ces sessions relient les concepts de conception à leur réalisation physique en encourageant l'expérimentation à l'échelle réelle.
Ici, le prototypage n'est pas seulement une technique, mais un état d'esprit - qui redéfinit notre approche du processus constructif.
Travailler directement avec des matériaux bruts remet en question les méthodes linéaires conventionnelles de conception et incite à une réévaluation critique de l'ensemble de la chaîne de production et d'approvisionnement, avec pour objectif de réduire l'empreinte écologique de la construction en bois.
From Prototype to Building IBOIS emphasizes material-driven design approaches.
Last year, they introduced the Integrally-Attached Timber Plate Structure (IATPS), which connects digital design directly to the fabrication process.
Digital technologies have shifted the architect's role into that of a maker.
The goal is to find optimal uses for specific materials and structural behaviours.
These digital tools also lower communication costs across the design process.
Today, prototypes offer an efficient medium of communication between human and machine and can be produced affordably using digital fabrication.
So, what is a prototype?
In architecture, a prototype is a full-scale or scaled-down model used to test, refine, and explore a design before construction.
It closes the gap between abstract ideas and physical implementation, revealing spatial qualities, material performance, building methods, and user interaction.
Unlike virtual models, physical prototypes allow direct engagement and make it easier to assess a design's real-world viability.
Architectural prototypes have always served as tools for experimentation - from Gaudi's intricate plaster models to today's 1:1 construction like the Khudi Bari in Bangladesh.
Whether used to address environmental conditions, construction challenges, or community needs, prototypes allow architects to test radical concepts while minimizing risk.
Especially in low-resource settings, prototyping blends creativity with necessity, resulting in innovative, adaptive structures grounded in real-life conditions.
In this studio workshop, we focus on three material themes.
First, interlocking self-bearing watertight envelops from timber.
Second, interlocking self-bearing watertight envelops from grasses.
Third, actively bended interlaced timber grids with projected earth.
The timber project, led by IBOIS, involves stacked trunks and watertight joinery.
The grasses' theme explores how vernacular traditions use layered bundles to create water-resistant shelter, reimagined through digital tools.
Lastly, bending timber grids form curved structures.
When layered with earth, they improve thermal insulation and protect the timber.
We'll propose ways to build these structures using spraying techniques and digital methods.
Building on the foundation of past research into prototyping and materials, Studio Weinand organizes a series of workshops centred on digital fabrication, complemented by site visits to observe material application and construction contexts firsthand.
These sessions connect design concepts with physical realization by encouraging full-scale experimentation.
Here, prototyping is not just a technique but a mindset - one that redefines how we approach the construction process.
Working directly with raw materials challenges conventional linear design workflows and prompts a critical revaluation of the entire production and supply chain, with the goal of reducing the ecological footprint of timber construction.
Le design studio porte sur un centre pour les femmes situé à Wau, au Sud-Soudan.
Il s'inscrit dans la continuité des expériences précédentes menées au sein du laboratoire FAR et, notamment, dans un programme axé sur le thème de l'architecture dans le domaine de la coopération internationale.
Région affectée par une pauvreté chronique et une instabilité politique, l'Afrique subsaharienne est également exposée au changement climatique et à ses conséquences sociales et environnementales.
Le design studio donnera donc l'occasion de réfléchir sur la capacité des architectes à apporter des réponses face aux situations extrêmes et aux contextes isolés d'un point de vue social, environnemental et économique.
Le programme fonctionnel se compose d'une clinique ambulatoire axée sur la santé des femmes (préparation à la maternité, santé reproductive, violence fondée sur le genre) et de locaux destinés à activités de formation et d'éducation.
L'exercice s'inscrit dans un contexte réel et se veut centré sur la relation entre l'engagement éthique et les limites de l'instrumentation disciplinaire/professionnelle, dans des circonstances qui sont, par définition, étrangères et éloignées, non seulement géographiquement, de la réalité de l'étudiant-e.
L'étudiant-e est activement confronté-e à plusieurs questions, non seulement architecturales, au centre du debat actuel :
utilisation responsable des ressources, inclusion, impact du changement climatique, participation, relations transculturelles.
La relation étroite avec la réalité implique la nécessité de mesurer, littéralement, le projet en termes de faisabilité économique et de durabilité globale.
A region affected by chronic poverty and political instability, sub-Saharan Africa is also exposed to climate change and its social and environmental consequences.
The studio will thus be used as an opportunity to reflect on architects' ability to provide responses to extreme situations and remote contexts at social, environmental, and economic level.
The functional programme includes an outpatient clinic focusing on women's health (maternity preparation, reproductive health, gender-based violence) and training and education activities.
The exercise is placed in a real context and is intended as centred on the relationship between ethical commitment and the limits of disciplinary/professional instrumentation, in circumstances that are, by definition, foreign, and remote, not only geographically, from the student's reality.
The student is actively confronted with many of the issues central to the debate today, not only architectural:
responsible use of resources, inclusiveness, impact of climate change, participation, transcultural relations.
The close relationship with reality implies the need to measure, literally, the project in terms of economic feasibility and overall sustainability.
The studio examines the effects of artificial intelligence on architecture and cities.
Generative tools are approached as cultural and political instruments, shaping design through data grounded in territory, economy, identity, imagery, and ecology.
In the wake of rogue LLMs, autonomous agents, opaque algorithms, and AI slop, architectural tools are undergoing a profound reconfiguration.
Generative design workflows and computational surrogates offer immense modeling power but also contribute to homogenization, "slopification," and erosion of critical authorship.
This studio investigates how AI might "design for itself," aiming to reclaim agency through the design of data and computational infrastructure.
Rather than treating AI as a self-effacing technical container, we approach it as a social, civic, and ethical instrument, embedded in territorial, ecological, and architectural contexts.
We examine the Urban Transformer (UT) as a novel typology:
a possible architecture for responsible and integrated AI infrastructure, and an inevitable one, whether we like it or not.
These structures may take the form of transparent data farms, distributed urban brains, or sentient infrastructural nodes.
They can appear as cohesive or decentralized systems, embedded within existing urban and suburban fabrics or as isolated techno-enclaves.
The Urban Transformer becomes a test case for how architecture can shape, and be shaped by, the infrastructural needs of intelligence, balancing physical constraints with civic, ecological, and symbolic demands.
The goals of the studio are threefold:
(1) to critically explore the use of generative AI in architectural design, tracing its risks and potentials beyond aesthetic automation;
(2) to invent an Urban Transformer prototypology that counters the tendency toward isolated, opaque, extractive techno-capitalist systems;
(3) to articulate a new architectural process and language for intelligence where form is shaped as much by energy demands, cooling logic, and physical storage as by the need for commons, symbolic resonance, public trust, and data transparency.
As AI's societal role remains contested, this studio positions architectural design as a crucial arena for negotiating how flows of intelligence become spatial, and how such architectures can mediate between technology and humanity.
This intensive studio will employ advanced digital tools and generative AI for "vibecoding" architecture.
Experimental and remote LLMs and MCP agents will be introduced as exploratory digital modeling tools.
A range of software, scripts, and plugins for mapping and open geodata analysis (e.g., Rhino & Grasshopper, QGIS), along with GenAI tools for representation (such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E), may act as co-design agents throughout the studio's successive phases.
No prior programming or software knowledge is required, but curiosity and strong motivation to learn are essential.
Des communauté shaker aux USA à la question du logement à Bâle, le semestre interroge l'habitat comme lieu intime et collectif, en explorant la transformation des espaces de travail en nouveaux lieu de partage.
Kommune in Basel 2025 HétérotopiePour la seconde année consécutive, le studio TEXAS s'appuie sur le texte de la conférence que Michel Foucault a prononcée en 1967, Des espaces autres - Hétérotopies.
Ce texte s'inscrit dans le cadre général de la description, par Foucault, de divers systèmes de domination.
Plus précisément, il nous concerne directement en tant qu'architectes, car il décrit la manière dont « il y a, et ceci, dans toute société, des utopies qui ont un lieu précis et réel, un lieu qu'on peut situer sur une carte, des utopies qui ont un temps qu'on peut fixer et déterminer, un temps qu'on peut fixer et mesurer selon le calendrier de tous les jours.
» Foucault prétend donc qu'une organisation spatiale singulière permet de construire des utopies qui sont, au sens strict du terme, habituellement des lieux sans lieu.
Transformer des laboratoires en logementsCe semestre, nous inventerons de telles utopies à partir de la transformation d'un immeuble de laboratoires construit à Bâle, au bord du Rhin, par Suter et Suter en 1967, en logements.
Pour ce faire, nous prendrons un des espaces habituels du logement - la chambre parentale, la chambre des enfants, la salle de bains, la circulation, la salle à manger, etc.
- et nous le mutualiserons, le rendrons collectif, à l'échelle de l'ensemble du bâtiment.
Pour justifier cela, dans chaque cas, les étudiant·e·s auront à imaginer les modes de vie et les règles internes de la communauté.
Liselotte et O.
Ungers, Kommunen in der Neuen Welt 1740-1972Pour stimuler et appuyer les réflexions, nous étudierons le livre de Liselotte et Oswald Mathias Ungers, Kommunen in der Neuen Welt 1740-1972, publié en 1972.
Le grand architecte et théoricien allemand et sa femme, sociologue, y décrivent la manière dont une série de communes, de communautés communistes, ont vu le jour aux USA du milieu du XVIIIe siècle au début des années 1970.
Motivées par des raisons politiques ou religieuses, ces communautés sont, par excellence, des hétérotopies, et mettent en évidence la manière dont organisation spatiale et sociale peuvent se définir mutuellement.
Le laboratoire TEXAS a produit une traduction française de l'ouvrage, disponible en allemand pour les étudiant·e·s.
The Shakers:
A World in the MakingPour expérimenter partiellement les espaces et objets d'une de ces communautés américaines, nous visiterons, à l'occasion de notre voyage d'étude qui se déroulera à Bâle du 13 au 15 septembre, l'exposition consacrée aux meubles shakers au Vitra Design Museum.
Les shakers sont une des communautés étudiées par le couple Ungers, et une des plus célèbres par ailleurs.
Soucieux de vivre dans une simplicité cohérente avec leur foi chrétienne, les shakers sont connus pour avoir développé des espaces et des objets qui entrent en résonance avec nos préoccupations contemporaines.« La beauté réside dans l'harmonie.
- L'ordre est le créateur de la beauté.
- La beauté repose sur l'utilité.
Toute beauté qui ne repose pas sur l'utilité devient rapidement insipide et doit être constamment remplacée.
» écrivaient-ils pour décrire les nombreuses règles qui régissaient leurs vies.Ce questionnement sur le rôle de l'utilité dans la définition de la beauté est, bien entendu, au cœur de tout projet d'architecture, cet art de la nécessité, et plus particulièrement d'un projet de logement, dans la mesure où il s'agit d'un des programmes qui réclament le plus de précision quant à l'usage et à la création d'un environnement agréable et significatif.
Steve McQueen, BassAfin de prolonger la réflexion sur la manière de rendre compte des systèmes de domination, en lien avec le travail de Foucault, nous nous confronterons à la capacité d'un artiste à travailler sur des questions sociales et historiques telles que la mémoire de l'esclavage ou les grèves de la faim menées par les militants irlandais dans les années 1980 dans les geôles britanniques, en visitant l'exposition Bass de l'artiste britannique d'origine caribéenne Steve McQueen, qui a actuellement lieu au Schaulager, un des bâtiments les plus remarquables de Herzog & de Meuron.
Après la visite, nous assisterons à une discussion entre Steve McQueen et Christina Sharpe, professeure de littérature anglaise et d'études sur les Noirs à l'Université York de Toronto.
La forme véhicule des valeurs :
cette notion, au cœur de notre enseignement, trouvera ici un écho direct.
Dan Graham, Rock My ReligionAfin de prolonger la réflexion sur les communautés communistes américaines et l'exposition sur les shakers, nous visionnerons, au cours des deux jours de séminaire de lancement du studio, les 8 et 9 septembre, le film Rock My Religion de l'artiste américain Dan Graham.
Aux confins de la sculpture, de l'architecture, de la culture pop et de la musique rock, Dan Graham a défini un champ de travail très spécifique, d'un intérêt majeur pour les architectes.
Dans ce film du début des années 1980, il propose l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'origine du rock et de sa dimension cathartique serait à rechercher dans les danses et les transes qui ont valu leur nom aux shakers.
Dans les temps troublés que nous vivons, la réflexion sur la transformation des bâtiments, d'une part, et la réflexion sur les modes d'organisation sociale et politique en lien avec l'organisation de l'espace, d'autre part, sont plus que jamais nécessaires.
C'est ce que nous explorerons cet automne, afin de continuer à comprendre dans quelles conditions la forme architecturale peut être émancipatrice plutôt que dominatrice, tout en étant, comme elle l'a toujours été, l'objet d'une discipline culturelle complexe qui met en œuvre, sur un pied d'égalité, valeurs mesurables et non mesurables.
L'atelier propose d'explorer le thème de la construction dans le territoire alpin, à la lumière des changements imposés par les transformations économiques et sociales qui s'opèrent ces dernières décennies.
Le programme prévoit de développer un lieu communautaire mêlant habitat et artisanat.
L Le travail du semestre a pour objectif l'expérimentation ponctuelle d'une stratégie de recolonisation de la vallée de l'Intyamon dans la région de la Gruyère (Fribourg) par le développement d'activités cohérentes avec leur condition géographique spécifique.
En partant de l'opportunité offerte par la présence de lignes de chemin de fer, construites à l'époque pour le développement touristique et industriel, certaines régions alpines ont aujourd'hui l'occasion de redéfinir leur identité culturelle et productive indépendamment de la monoculture hôtelière ou extractive.
Dans ce contexte, l'atelier propose d'explorer le thème de la construction dans le territoire alpin à la lumière des changements imposés par les transformations économiques et sociales qui s'opèrent ces dernières décennies.
Le site pour cette année sera le village d'Albeuve, sur la ligne de train qui relie Montreux à Bulle.
L'objectif pragmatique est de s'appuyer sur l'infrastructure ferroviaire existante pour induire de nouvelles synergies et une densification de la vallée de l'Intyamon.
L'abandon de la monoculture touristique et de l'exploitation extractive est le postulat principal sur lequel se base le travail expérimental de l'atelier.
Le projet est envisagé parallèlement comme outil critique de lecture du territoire dans ses formes culturelles et matérielles, et comme dispositif pratique permettant d'affirmer une vision politique et intellectuelle de l'état actuel des choses, afin d'influencer de manière active la dynamique des transformations en cours.
L'hypothèse est que, à travers de micro-interventions il soit possible de construire des dynamiques de développement et de sauvegarde des territoires en crise.
En effet, la mise en œuvre d'une "recolonisation" viable pour la condition spécifique des vallées de montagne doit passer par l'utilisation pertinente et consciente de la culture architecturale.
Dans cette optique, le projet d'architecture permet d'expérimenter des stratégies sensibles et durables dans une condition par sa nature résistante à toute intervention extérieure.
Les bâtiments projetés chercheront à assumer le caractère du lieu au sens positif qui ne se limite pas à lire passivement l'histoire et le présent ou à interpréter le contexte et les figures autochtones, mais qui soit à même d'écrire une contribution originale de la spécificité du lieu au travers des formes de l'architecture.
La recherche d'un équilibre culturel, social et durable se matérialise dans chaque projet architectural et dans la réponse chorale à l'échelle de la vallée étudiée, de l'implantation aux solutions constructives et à la séquence typologique, d'usage et de maintenance.
Le programme de l'atelier s'inscrit dans un dessein plus général de redéfinition critique des concepts d'identité locale et de valeurs traditionnelles afin de soutenir et d'encourager un processus ouvert et partagé de renaissance démographique et culturelle des régions périphériques.
Plus précisément, le programme prévoit de développer un système cohérent d'activités artisanales et d'habitations collectives.
L'ensemble d'une quinzaine de projets, tous à implanter sur des parcelles différentes et en relation les unes avec les autres, constituera un Forum Alpinum, c'est-à-dire un lieu communautaire de rencontre et d'échange.
Concevoir un lieu pour la collectivité dans une condition alpine signifie partir de la condition géographique de son territoire en tant que système, et donc considérer que les fonctions sociales, commerciales et productives sont inséparables les unes des autres.
Is it conceivable to question the very presence of highways in urban environments?
What potential for requalification does this space, with its unique characteristics, offer?
This is the central question that the Design Studio will explore during the spring semester, producing "counter-projects" aimed at overcoming, dismantling, adapting, repurposing, and reconceptualizing the highway barriers still present within the city.
Several Swiss cities are intersected by stretches of the national road network, remnants of a bygone era.
Today, these roads act as barriers to urban movement, sources of air and noise pollution, and spaces of congestion, as the massive traffic volumes they channel into the city are excessive.
The first step is to identify and map these areas;
the second is to develop hypotheses about their potential evolution.
Drawing on existing research, site visits, and project development, the Design Studio will generate ideas and perspectives to be debated collectively and publicly.
****************************************************************** Celle-ci est l'interrogation que l'Atelier développera dans le semestre de printemps qui produira des « contre-projets » urbains de dépassement, démantèlement, adaptation, réutilisation, reconceptualisation des barreaux autoroutiers encore présents dans la ville.
Plusieurs villes suisses sont traversées par des tronçons du réseau des routes nationales helvétiques qui appartiennent à une époque dévolue :
ils agissent, aujourd'hui, comme des barrières aux mouvements de la ville, des pollueurs de l'air et acoustique, des espaces congestionnés car les grands volumes de trafic qu'ils amènent en ville est excessif.
Il s'agit d'abord de les repérer, de les cartographier et, deuxième, de développer des hypothèses de leur évolution.
A partir de recherches déjà développées, de visites des sites et de la construction de projets, l'Atelier fournira des idées et des points de vue à débattre collectivement et publiquement.
La ville comme une maison - La petite maison associative Voyage d'étude - Paris LA MAISON COMME UNE VILLE LA PETITE MAISON ASSOCIATIVE DOMESTIC CITY-LAB (DC-LAB) STUDIO SOPHIE DELHAY assistée par Harry Waknine & Melchior Dechancé UNE THEME, L'HABITAT Constituant près de 80 % du grain de la ville, l'habitat est un levier décisif pour encourager les relations sociales, de soin, tout en réduisant nos besoins en ressources et en énergie, afin de faire évoluer la ville et le logement dans un même mouvement.
Travailler sur l'habitat, c'est trouver les formes pour rendre possible un monde plus juste d'un point de vue social, spatial, dans une écologie des rapports humains.
Le studio voit l'habitat comme le point de départ d'une architecture qui met au centre une vie intimement collective et solidaire, et qui explore des territoires à partir de leur caractère domestique.
Espaces et Usages:
L'habitat rend compte de dimensions spatiales, sociales et environnementales.
Ses dimensions spatiales sont proprement liées à la discipline architecturale (à la composition de plan, aux qualités constructives, matérielles, atmosphériques) ;
ses dimensions sociales sont liées aux modes de vie et aux usages ;
ses dimensions environnementales sont liées à ses besoins d'économie d'espace, de moyens, de matière et d'énergie.
Nous pensons l'habitat comme un principe émancipatoire capable, à l'aune des crises sociales et climatiques qui nous traversent, de révolutionner nos villes depuis l'intérieur.
L'habitat est un outil puissant pour concevoir une ville et une société plus justes, plus durables, vertueuses et hédonistes.
Territoires intimes:
Le studio situe l'habitat dans un spectre plus vaste que celui du logement.
L'habitat est un espace tendu entre la petite et la grande échelle :
entre le mobilier et le territoire, l'échelle domestique et l'échelle urbaine, le corps et la ville, le temps court des gestes quotidiens et le temps long des vies qui s'y succèdent.
L'habitat est aussi le lieu où s'entremêlent des usages ordinaires et extraordinaires, des aspects fonctionnels et poétiques, des habitudes et des surprises.
L'habitat est donc à la fois rationnel et poétique, concret et abstrait, immanent et ontologique, fondé sur notre capacité à se projeter, à rêver demain, et à être fondés par notre mémoire et nos désirs.
En bref, l'habitat établit avant tout des rapports, des articulations, et met en perspective des opposés, des notions a priori contradictoires ou habituellement dissociées.
L'habitat est le lieu du lien.
UN OUTIL, LA CUISINE La cuisine est prise comme point de départ des deux semestres.
Tout comme l'architecture, la cuisine est à la fois un espace (une pièce), un usage (le repas), un temps (un rituel), mais aussi un besoin vital (où l'on pourvoit à la subsistance) et un fait culturel (la gastronomie).
C'est aussi une discipline vernaculaire et exploratoire - locale et globale - entre cuisine traditionnelle et nouvelle cuisine.
Nous proposons d'interpréter et d'analyser l'espace de la cuisine sous quatre angles :
- En tant qu'espace social :
lieu où se déroule la commensalité, mais aussi espace approprié par ses habitants à travers la pratique incarnée de la préparation du repas.
- En tant qu'espace politique, révélateur des relations de pouvoir liées au travail productif et reproductif.
Il est aussi l'espace du logement le plus genré.
- En tant qu'espace hédoniste, où la gastronomie et la technique s'allient pour que la subsistance se transforme en plaisir partagé.
- En tant qu'espace climatique, équipé d'une alimentation en eau, d'appareils de cuisson, de réfrigérateurs et d'extracteurs d'air, elle pourrait jouer un rôle important dans le bien-être climatique de l'habitation, comme c'était le cas avant l'ère industrielle.
Pour toutes ces raisons, la cuisine est un outil puissant pour transformer politiquement, socialement et climatiquement la production standardisée de l'habitat.
La cuisine est aussi le lieu des sens et des plaisirs, et peut stimuler une architecture plus hédoniste.
1 RECHERCHE, 2 SEMESTRES Nous vous proposons d'explorer deux scénarios où les distinctions entre intérieur et extérieur, petite dimension et grande dimension, habituellement dévolues d'un côté au logement, de l'autre à la ville, seraient recomposées différemment.
Il s'agirait ici d'une même chose :
l'habitat.
Dans cet esprit, on vivrait la maison comme une ville et la ville comme une maison.
LA MAISON COMME UNE VILLE LA PETITE MAISON ASSOCIATIVE Ce semestre de printemps, le studio étudiera le campus de l'EPFL de manière immersive, à la petite échelle, autour de la question d'un centre estudiantin.
Au-delà des espaces consacrés à l'enseignement, à la recherche et à l'administration, des espaces accueillent la vie de la communauté des étudiant·e·x·s et de leurs associations.
Le studio crée collectivement un portrait domestique du campus de l'EPFL en observant les usages partagés, formels et informels de ces espaces.
Made-in EPFL:
Ce portrait domestique révèle un ensemble de thèmes, à la fois spatiaux et d'usages, spécifiques au campus.
Chacun d'eux est développé par deux groupes à travers un atlas cartographique, et un inventaire qui décrit et classe les situations analogues.
Les atlas cartographiques servent de base à de possibles stratégies de transformation pour le campus, chacune inspirée par son caractère domestique.
Sur cette base, un site est choisi pour la conception d'une maison associative, accueillant les activités des associations et développant l'appropriation par les étudiant·e·x·s de l'ensemble du campus.
Public Interior:
Le centre étudiant est conçu comme un espace public intérieur répondant aux besoins non académiques des étudiant·e·s.
Il offre un accès à des services, des espaces et des programmes, rapproche les différentes communautés, favorise l'engagement et l'organisation de la vie associative du campus.
Les projets s'appuieront sur la théorie du Public Interior explorée par Mark Pimlott dans son livre The Public Interior as Idea and Project, qui comprend le Palace, la Ruine, le Réseau, le Jardin, et la Machine.
Partages:
Au-delà du programme attendu, l'alimentation, par sa dimension sociale et économique, servira de prétexte aux liens tissés entre étudiant·e·x·s.
La conception d'une cafétéria autogérée offrira un espace privilégié pour questionner les modalités d'accès à une alimentation quotidienne abordable, tout en explorant la dimension collective qui peut émerger autour du partage du repas.
Greenhouse Studies explore le potentiel des structures de serres dans le contexte des défis contemporains.
Les ateliers de projet étudient les serres comme un type architectural sensible au climat, capable de transformer des structures existantes en espaces collectifs et communautaires.
GREENHOUSE STUDIES III 'Clothing as an extension of our skin helps to store and to channel energy, ...If clothing is an extension of our private skins to store and channel our own heat and energy, housing is a collective means of achieving the same end for the family or the group.
Housing as shelter is an extension of our bodily heat-control mechanisms - a collective skin or garment.' Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media:
The Extensions of Man (Cambridge:
MIT Press, 1911) Following a first design studio on greenhouses, Laboratory EAST presents Greenhouse Studies II - The collective (Fall semester), and Greenhouse studies III - The common (Spring semester), the laboratory's second and third interaction with a unique element in the history of architecture.
The studio is interested in the multiple uses of greenhouse spaces outside the horticultural context.
In Greenhouse Studies I, the design studio took a cross-sectional look at domestic greenhouses as a space for expanding the individual home.
The greenhouse served as garden for vegetables, as passive heating device, or extra living room.
Through superposition, juxtaposition, or all-over solutions, the greenhouse spatial structure constituted a new thermal buffer zone that interacted differently with the existing volumes.
In Greenhouse Studies II and III, the studio will continue the survey, aware of new dimensions:
from the individual to the collective, from the collective to the common, from the small villa scale to the collective housing, from collective housing to common programs.
Together we will build on these concepts while exploring greenhouse-like solutions.
What are the implications of such change?
The results will contribute to an open-source, collaborative database that will grow each semester.
Type and Typology as framework Typology is recognised as a fundamental concept for a better understanding of architecture and its history.
It serves as a basic framework, a kind of tacit backbone for the organisation of architectural knowledge and can also be a tool for generating new architectural solutions.
Some argue that typology is as old as architecture itself, as it involves the reproduction of dominant types and models that are deeply rooted in socio-cultural realities.
Alternatively, it can be said that architecture responds to new social and economic needs by inventing or revising existing types.
Typology and types traditionally interact with the formal dimension (buildings organised by a common form or element) and the functional dimension (buildings organised by a common function).
However, this focus has often overlooked other, less tangible possibilities, such as structural relationships between types and climate in architecture.
Climatic Type as central theme Conservatories, greenhouses, glasshouses, forcing houses, hothouses, invernaderos in Spanish, orangeries, jardins d' hiver or serres in French - many are the terms associated with the idea of housing plants.
All of these artefacts have a common goal:
to create a climate adapted to plant life.
Although greenhouses were conceived with a very precise objective, this climatic space quickly became an exhibition space, a social space, and even a space for celebrations before it fell into disuse.
In the second half of the 20th century, greenhouse-based solutions made a comeback, fostering solar architecture and reinforcing the foundations of bioclimatic architecture in western societies.
During this time, horticulture continued developing greenhouses as productive spaces, and innovations led to intensive fields of production.
In absolute terms, it is not the form or function that characterizes the greenhouse but the definition of a space with specific climatic conditions.
In most cases, using wood or metal structures and transparent materials such as glass, these structures keep a very low ratio between the material used and the enclosed space, offering the most with the least.
The characterization of the greenhouse as an artefact of a climatic nature suggests that the greenhouse as a type does not depend on scale or size.
Since its inception, the multiform and multifunctional greenhouse space has been transformed into a social space with very specific microclimatic characteristics.

From Log Id's logbook.
In LOG ID (ed.), Gruene Archen - Harmonie mit Pflanzen leben das Modell der Gruppe LOG ID (Frankfurt am Main:
Fricke Verlag, 1983) Unfolding over the course of two semesters, both design studios will explore the dynamics between greenhouses, greenhouse components or greenhouse functions and existing building structures as architectural forms, climatic spaces and temporary uses of space:
In the spring semester, Greenhouse studies III - The common, we focus exclusively on the communal dimensions of the greenhouse as a place for work and social interaction.
The design studio will investigate how climate-based architecture can be implemented by designing a student house at EPFL Campus.
The common space should be the centre of the student community and a critical review of contemporary space utilisation.
The development of both phases will be undertaken in groups consisting of two or three students, and a Seminar Day will comprise a series of multidisciplinary theoretical contributions from external experts.
We will investigate the possible interactions between two different architectural spaces, and gain a better understanding of the typological transfers and climatic synergies between them.
Greenhouse-like structures offer the opportunity to investigate prefabricated systems, test designs for deconstruction and reversibility in design thinking, and ultimately find a 'lighter' way to redesign existing buildings.
By looking at greenhouses as specific built environments, the studio will formulate solutions based on the concept of architecture as atmosphere, while exploring its transformative potential.
In addition, the studio will examine greenhouses as climate-responsive artefacts, exploring how seasons can change spaces, or, in other words, what it means to inhabit spaces seasonally.
If we change clothes according to the seasons, should our buildings change too?
Practicalities Each semester will be composed of two parts.
The first part - Research on precedents - will be developed individually to expand the corpus of references and help us learn from existing buildings.
The studio will collectively build a visual atlas made of peculiar, strange or remarkable case-studies.
The design study will analyse the characteristics of the case studies, like:
flexible use of space, evaluate their thermal behaviour throughout the seasons, formmaking aspects, thermical airflow and mechanics of openings.
The key findings from this body of references will inform the design phase.
In the second part - Design Studio - participants will develop their own design in groups of two or three.
Learning outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to:
Apply and present research capable to inform a design project Analyse and interpret critically an architectural work Formulate a problem and provide design-based solution Represent accurately a design proposal with drawings and models at multiple scales Develop a narrative and present arguments to specialised and non-specialised audiences Develop awareness about the implicit and explicit messages of an architectural project Work collaboratively and integrate knowledge from different disciplines
This studio explores construction materials, their origins and supply chains, the norms that regulate their use, and deploys that as a brief to explore how a post-extractive architecture could emerge and become prevalent.

Course Description:Nota Bene:
This studio is part of the 'Moratorium on New Construction' cycle, one of RIOT's meta agenda, following a series of topics seeking to center systemic change in architecture and the building industry.
This means the class will prioritize radical designs that engage with repair, remediation, care, tactical interventions, system design and policy making, and interrogate architecture as the sole 'art of building buildings.' Architecture is here at the forefront, considered both as a problem but also as a powerful tool for change, if and when it is used as such.
Halt Extraction "You know that we are living in a material world," Madonna, Matthew E.
Marston / Paul Christopher Brown, © Sony/atv Songs Llc, Imagem Publishing Ltd.
'Halt Extraction' scrutinizes the intersection of design disciplines with extractivism and resource exploitation, focusing on developing post-extractive architectural and urban design strategies.
The studio investigates how construction materials transform the Earth's resources into our built environment through global and local supply chains, and how design can contribute to post-extractive architectures.
Grounded in arguments explored in the forthcoming book "A Moratorium on New Construction," we seek to address the political problems of construction as designers.
The course progresses through two main phases:
1) The research phase establishes a comprehensive understanding of how design disciplines intersect with extractivism and resource exploitation through mapping the global and local chains of construction materials and uncovering the normative systems in place that regulate their use in design strategies.
By investigating construction materials (i.e., plaster, wood, concrete, brick, steel) and their political economy (how value is extracted from them), we hope to unpack how the industry translates the Earth's resources into our built environment.
We also seek to understand the normative regulations, specs, and legal frameworks that dictate how these materials are deployed in construction.
2) Framed by these regulatory limits and equipped with critical thinking, we will devise design strategies that do not rely on destruction and exhaustion to produce spaces.
During the design phase, building on this foundation, we will engage with mainly existing structures rather than defaulting to new construction, using current market conditions as testing grounds for alternative approaches.
Site We will work in real-life conditions in the context of Switzerland.
Scales This studio is based on a conception of urban design as a multidimensional trans-scalar discipline.
Not only political, economic, social, cultural, and geo-tectonic forces affect and shape the built environment at the planetary and global scale, at the territorial and landscape scale, at the neighborhood and urban scale, down to the architectural and material scale - and to the body of the human and more-than-human, but space and its arrangements have a reciprocating effect on these forces, humans, and non-humans acting upon them.
We will design within these gradations, positing that each constituent scale is distinct and can be considered on its own, yet the piece as a whole is only complete with each scale, resulting in the sum of all the small scales producing a large-scale total.[2] The studio engages with complex issues surrounding the political economy of space production, the actors, forces and mechanisms that generate the spaces we inhabit.
We will also think around temporal scales to challenge "impatient capital" as it dictates architectural, urban, and landscape projects for immediacy, exploring seemingly contradictory notions of ephemeral and impermanent, durable, and longevity as frameworks for operation.
L'atelier consiste en une mise en situation de projet dans l'existant, à a fois concrète et prospective.
Celle-ci s'étend du diagnostic à la réhabilitation, en passant par la reprogrammation.
La création d'un Student Center sur le campus historique de l'EPFL (1984) est notre objet d'étude.
EPFL Student Center L'atelier ADHER s'est proposé de contribuer à la réflexion collective quant à la création d'un Student Center sur le campus de l'EPFL.
Ce projet prévoit le regroupement des locaux des diverses associations de l'EPFL, pour libérer des surfaces d'enseignement et de recherche et simplifier l'organisation d'évènements.
Ce faisant, il s'agit de répondre à la demande des étudiants d'avoir un espace qui leur est dédié.
Celui-ci intègrera salles de réunion, bureaux et stockage de matériel sur environ 3.000 m2.
Parmi les différents ateliers impliqués dans ce processus de manière critique et proactive, l'atelier ADHER, de par sa méthodologie, propose que ce projet s'incarne nécessairement à travers une intervention en prise directe avec le bâtiment historique de 1984 :
transformation, surélévation, extension, etc.
Le potentiel du patrimoine La mise au jour du potentiel d'un bâti existant, qu'il soit protégé ou ordinaire, implique son étude préalable.
À travers elle, il s'agit de s'approprier les méthodes et les outils spécifiques de l'étude patrimoniale.
Leur maîtrise, à laquelle tend à initier cette première séquence, participe d'une meilleure compréhension de ce qui est déjà là, en vue d'une intervention.
Il s'agit également de prendre conscience que cette étude constitue une part intégrante du projet et pas seulement une phase liminaire, dépourvue d'intentions conceptuelles.
L'étude patrimoniale intègre le relevé de l'existant sur site, son étude historique et sa critique d'authenticité à partir des archives ainsi que son diagnostic technique et sanitaire.
La mener à bien suppose d'adopter une démarche pluridisciplinaire en impliquant des spécialistes tels que des ingénieurs, des entreprises et des chercheurs.
Cette phase d'étude constitue également une opportunité de s'interroger sur les modes de représentation de l'architecture et du paysage.
Par ailleurs, il est important de rappeler que l'ensemble de ces méthodes et outils ne constitue pas seulement un corpus figé de procédés expérimentés mais bien un champ de recherche contemporain, expérimental et continu.
Restaurer, transformer, créer Il existe différents types d'intervention dans l'existant, de la restauration à la création, en passant par la transformation.
Ces derniers ne doivent pas être déterminés a priori mais résulter des conclusions de l'étude patrimoniale, en particulier de celles relatives à la valeur patrimoniale.
Le potentiel de celle-ci ne se révèlera concrètement qu'à travers ces interventions.
Pour servir au présent, l'existant peut ainsi nécessiter une restauration, totale ou partielle, impliquer une transformation d'une de ses parties, voire exiger une création, sous la forme d'une extension par exemple.
De plus, au-delà du type d'intervention, se pose la question du parti pris.
En effet, chacun de ces types se décline pour participer au mieux à un projet cohérent.
Ces interventions doivent être contextualisées (c'est-à-dire définies par rapport au site, aux matériaux, aux mises en œuvre, etc.) et inscrites parmi celles de nombreux partenaires (ingénieurs et entreprises spécialisés).
Bioclimatisme et enjeux contemporains L'intervention dans l'existant est une pratique ancienne bien que résolument contemporaine, en phase avec les enjeux écologiques et sociaux d'aujourd'hui.
Elle attire notre attention sur la capacité d'adaptation de ce qui est déjà là et de ce que nous construisons.
Cette adaptabilité s'entend bien sûr sur le plan des usages mais également sur ceux de l'environnement et du confort, notamment face au dérèglement climatique.
Ainsi, une intervention dans l'existant nécessite de l'appréhender au prisme d'une conception bioclimatique.
En phase d'étude, cela signifie d'en identifier les faiblesses thermiques, hygrométriques et acoustiques mais aussi les potentialités d'éclairage et de ventilation naturels.
En phase de projet, il ne s'agit donc pas de mettre en œuvre des solutions ex nihilo mais davantage d'optimiser l'isolation, de valoriser les apports solaires ou encore d'améliorer la ventilation naturelle.
Pour ce faire et poursuivre un objectif d'une moindre empreinte carbone, on peut privilégier le recours à la végétation, l'utilisation de matériaux biosourcés ou encore le remploi de matériaux.
Loin de nous décourager, ces enjeux doivent donc nous responsabiliser et nous pousser à agir en nous saisissant, par exemple, du patrimoine comme d'une ressource et un point d'appui générateur de projet.
Conception of collective housing within real-world constraints, through the problematized handling of a variety of modes of representation.
good housing.
Topic, context, economies.The aim of the semester is to propose alternatives forms of housing in conditions as close as possible to that of actual practice, and to make virtue out their concrete limitations.
Low budgets and narrow-minded norms will become opportunities, all participating in shaping the possibility of something that could be called good housing.
Multiplicity, ambition.The semester will sail against the idea that an academic exercise has to be reductive, and that the complexities of the whole cannot be grasped at once by a project.
Through precise and multi-faceted projects, we will thus reduce to minimum the distances between what is good for each inhabitant, what is good for the neighbors, what is good for the urban setting, what is good according to the givens of a brief, what is good in terms of sustainability, in terms of affordability, in terms of beauty, in terms of construction, or in terms of the sensible distribution of spatial resources.
Housing as choreography.
Housing as act.No lens is ever neutral, passive, or objective.
Starting from plans inevitably leads to a different project than doing it from collages or details.
The way one furnishes or not a perspective is similarly charged with implications and meanings.One of the objectives of the semester is to shape clear standpoints regarding this necessary state of failed objectivity.
Throughout the development of the work, representation will problematized as a set of tools allowing to rethink the conditions of intelligibility of a given problem â here public housing.
A wide array of modes of representation will be experimented with, selected, used and distorted, according to specific intents, ultimately shaping the projects themselves and their focus.
Typological Urbanism bridges architecture and urbanism through dual perspectives:
architectural typologies shaping urban form from within, and urban types shaping it from without.
Working across scales, the studio explores evolving Swiss urban contexts through ensemble and composite forms.
Architecture versus Urbanism The term Typological Urbanism refers to a design method situated at the overlap of architecture and urbanism.
In our understanding, urbanism is neither the outcome of engineered masterplans - where form is determined and filled with program - nor the product of a loose collection of autonomous architectural objects.
Instead, we believe in a strong interdependency between architecture and urbanism.
We recognize a conceptual gap in practice between these two disciplines.
Typological Urbanism allows us to respond with precision to the multiple dimensions of the urban condition - context, program, and existing fabric - without relying on idealistic projections.
Instead, it operates through inherent rules:
robust yet flexible enough to be reassembled in every moment.
This assemblage relies in a fluent state, like the work of Imi Knoebel it can feel assembled and disassembled at the same time.
This ambiguity and open-endedness enable appropriation and identification.
A Dual Approach Typological Urbanism can be approached from two complementary directions:
From within:
architectural typologies (such as housing) generate spatial organization and in turn shape urban form.
From without:
predefined or emergent urban types constitute our built environment, including aspects such as open space, program, ownership, and accessibility.
This duality reflects the legacy of modernist thought - its search for rationality - and its postmodern revision, which reintroduced context, memory, and multiplicity into design.
Synthesizing these principles enables us to resist both dogmatism and nostalgia.
Working Across Scales This duality is not contradictory;
on the contrary, it becomes our design method.
To investigate it, we will work simultaneously on two scales:
the individual unit and the urban figure.
By studying how these two levels interact, we aim to reveal deeper spatial relationships.
Our starting point will be specific housing typologies, through which we will analyse spatial logics and organizational principles.
From there, we will scale outward - investigating how abstract volumes relate to one another within a larger spatial composition.
The central question becomes:
can the relationships and conditions identified at the architectural scale be translated into, or discovered within, the urban dimension?
Sites of Urban Reassembly In the Swiss context, urban development is no longer driven by expansion into open land, but by the densification and transformation of existing environments.
Within these already-defined boundaries, most areas transitioning from industrial or infrastructural uses to residential, commercial, services or public functions have now been developed.
Yet some questions remain.
Our investigations extend beyond these specific zones and apply equally to the mixed-use city, to urban areas growing across municipal lines, to agglomerations evolving into coherent urban forms, and to housing settlements striving for greater density and urban character.
Urban Ensemble or Urban Composite Over the course of the academic year, each semester will prioritize one aspect of this duality within a design project:
Semester 1:
The Urban Ensemble (Zurich):
Focused on how urban form emerges from the interaction of typologies in a loose arrangement of buildings.
Semester 2:
The Urban Composite (Lausanne):
Investigates the idea of a hybrid building - a type in itself that incorporates multiple typologies.
Challenging outdated zoning laws, we will apply a consistent programmatic set in each context - a mix of uses tailored to local conditions, yet designed to ensure that a piece of city can emerge and evolve.
Le studio Weinand adopte une approche de conception axée sur l'expérimentation des matériaux et le prototypage, en se concentrant sur le bois, les herbes et la terre.
À l'IBOIS, une riche expérience guide l'exploration de prototypes reliant concepts architecturaux et réalité construite.
Du prototype au bâtiment L'IBOIS met l'accent sur des approches de conception guidées par les matériaux.
L'année dernière, ils ont introduit la Structure en plaques de bois à fixation intégrale (IATPS), qui relie directement la conception numérique au processus de fabrication.
Les technologies numériques ont transformé le rôle de l'architecte, désormais aussi celui d'un fabricant.
L'objectif est de trouver les usages optimaux pour des matériaux spécifiques et des comportements structurels précis.
Ces outils numériques réduisent également les coûts de communication tout au long du processus de conception.
Aujourd'hui, les prototypes offrent un moyen de communication efficace entre l'homme et la machine, et peuvent être produits à moindre coût grâce à la fabrication numérique.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'un prototype?
En architecture, un prototype est une maquette à l'échelle réelle ou réduite, utilisée pour tester, affiner et explorer un projet avant la construction.
Il comble l'écart entre les idées abstraites et leur mise en œuvre physique, en révélant les qualités spatiales, les performances matérielles, les méthodes de construction et l'interaction avec l'utilisateur.
Contrairement aux modèles virtuels, les prototypes physiques permettent un engagement direct et facilitent l'évaluation de la viabilité réelle d'un projet.
Les prototypes architecturaux ont toujours servi d'outils d'expérimentation - des modèles en plâtre complexes de Gaudí aux constructions à l'échelle 1:1 comme la Khudi Bari au Bangladesh.
Qu'ils soient utilisés pour répondre à des conditions environnementales, à des défis constructifs ou à des besoins communautaires, les prototypes permettent aux architectes de tester des concepts radicaux tout en minimisant les risques.
En particulier dans les contextes à faibles ressources, le prototypage associe crèativité et nécessité, aboutissant à des structures innovantes et adaptatives, ancrées dans des conditions réelles.
En s'appuyant sur les recherches passées en matière de prototypage et de matériaux, le Studio Weinand organise une série d'ateliers centrés sur la fabrication numérique, complétés par des visites de sites afin d'observer directement l'application des matériaux et les contextes constructifs.
Ces sessions relient les concepts de conception à leur réalisation physique en encourageant l'expérimentation à l'échelle réelle.
Ici, le prototypage n'est pas seulement une technique, mais un état d'esprit - qui redéfinit notre approche du processus constructif.
Travailler directement avec des matériaux bruts remet en question les méthodes linéaires conventionnelles de conception et incite à une réévaluation critique de l'ensemble de la chaîne de production et d'approvisionnement, avec pour objectif de réduire l'empreinte écologique de la construction en bois.
From Prototype to Building IBOIS emphasizes material-driven design approaches.
Last year, they introduced the Integrally-Attached Timber Plate Structure (IATPS), which connects digital design directly to the fabrication process.
Digital technologies have shifted the architect's role into that of a maker.
The goal is to find optimal uses for specific materials and structural behaviours.
These digital tools also lower communication costs across the design process.
Today, prototypes offer an efficient medium of communication between human and machine and can be produced affordably using digital fabrication.
So, what is a prototype?
In architecture, a prototype is a full-scale or scaled-down model used to test, refine, and explore a design before construction.
It closes the gap between abstract ideas and physical implementation, revealing spatial qualities, material performance, building methods, and user interaction.
Unlike virtual models, physical prototypes allow direct engagement and make it easier to assess a design's real-world viability.
Architectural prototypes have always served as tools for experimentation-from Gaudi's intricate plaster models to today's 1:1 construction like the Khudi Bari in Bangladesh.
Whether used to address environmental conditions, construction challenges, or community needs, prototypes allow architects to test radical concepts while minimizing risk.
Especially in low-resource settings, prototyping blends creativity with necessity, resulting in innovative, adaptive structures grounded in real-life conditions.
In this studio workshop, we focus on three material themes.
First, interlocking self-bearing watertight envelops from timber.
Second, interlocking self-bearing watertight envelops from grasses.
Third, actively bended interlaced timber grids with projected earth.
The timber project, led by IBOIS, involves stacked trunks and watertight joinery.
The grasses' theme explores how vernacular traditions use layered bundles to create water-resistant shelter, reimagined through digital tools.
Lastly, bending timber grids form curved structures.
When layered with earth, they improve thermal insulation and protect the timber.
We'll propose ways to build these structures using spraying techniques and digital methods.
Building on the foundation of past research into prototyping and materials, Studio Weinand organizes a series of workshops centred on digital fabrication, complemented by site visits to observe material application and construction contexts firsthand.
These sessions connect design concepts with physical realization by encouraging full-scale experimentation.
Here, prototyping is not just a technique but a mindset - one that redefines how we approach the construction process.
Working directly with raw materials challenges conventional linear design workflows and prompts a critical revaluation of the entire production and supply chain, with the goal of reducing the ecological footprint of timber construction.
Une intervention humanitaire d'urgence, à savoir la mise en place d'un Early Childhood Development Centre dans le camp de réfugiés de Zaatari, en Jordanie, fait l'objet du design studio.
Le projet s'inscrit dans la continuité des expériences précédentes menées au sein du laboratoire FAR.
Bien que les camps de réfugiés soient de plus en plus considérés comme la dernière option en cas d'urgence, et qu'il existe aujourd'hui un large débat sur les différentes stratégies et approches permettant de les éviter, le camp reste une réalité qu'il est difficile d'éliminer, d'ignorer ou de négliger.
La pertinence de cette question est d'autant plus grande si l'on considère la tendance des camps à se transformer en établissements permanents.
Cette expérience examinera comment la conception architecturale peut répondre aux besoins fondamentaux et aux conditions difficiles qui caractérisent les scénarios humanitaires.
Quant à la conception visant la coopération pour le développement, il existe des possibles catégories d'interventions, avec des incursions de noms importants du panorama architectural qui feront l'objet d'une analyse et d'une réflexion.
Le camp de réfugiés constitue probablement le terme extrême auquel se référer pour questionner les limites, les conditions et les potentialités de la conception architecturale :
les conditions d'urgence (avec leur corollaire de ressources limitées et d'impérativité intrinsèque des interventions) sont généralement utilisées pour justifier des approches managériales et technocratiques, qui semblent exclure l'espace pour le discours architectural, perçu (et souvent présenté) comme auxiliaire, voire complètement hors de propos.
Pour recueillir des données sur le contexte, une approche médico-légale, désormais pratiquée dans ces contextes et dans des contextes similaires, peut être déployée sur la base de la quantité considérable d'informations disponibles.
A la suite de cette analyse des informations disponibles et à l'étude des références, les étudiant-e-s sont censé-e-s développer un mode d'intervention cohérent et réaliste.
Ils-Elles seront appelé-e-s à concevoir un système constructif intégré reproduisible dans des circonstances similaires, un prototype pouvant entrer dans le circuit de production, industriel ou non.
Although refugee camps are increasingly seen as the last option in case of emergency, and there is now widespread debate about different strategies and approaches to avoid them, the camp remains a reality which is difficult to eliminate, ignore or neglect.
The relevance of this issue is made all the more pressing where one considers the tendency of camps to turn into permanent settlements.
This experience will consider how architectural design can respond to the basic needs and difficult conditions that characterise humanitarian scenarios.
As for design aimed at cooperation for development there are possible categorizations of the interventions, with incursions by prominent names of the architectural panorama that will be the subject of analysis and reflection.
The refugee camp probably constitutes the extreme term to refer to when questioning the limits, conditions, and potentialities of architectural design:
emergency conditions (with their corollary of limited resources and intrinsic urgency of interventions) usually are used to justify managerial and technocratic approaches, which seem to exclude space for architectural discourse, perceived (and often presented) as ancillary when even completely irrelevant.
Following this analysis of the available information and the study of references, students are expected to develop a coherent and realistic mode of intervention.
Students will be required to conceive an integrated building system to be replicated in similar circumstances, a prototype that can enter the production circuit, industrial or otherwise.
L'atelier explore des nouveaux processus paramétriques et intelligences artificielles de concevoir la forme architecturale à des échelles différentes.
En poursuivant notre exploration du concept d'hétérotopies, nous nous pencherons sur la transformation des barres de logements dans le quartier de Sarcelles.
Ce travail sera enrichi par une analyse des textes de Michel Foucault ainsi que par une représentation des espaces qu'il décrit.
Hétérotopies 95 200 Simplisme vs complexitéEn ce moment de crise politique globale, où la montée de l'extrême droite et de l'illibéralisme, aux États-Unis, en Europe ou encore dans le Sud global, menace la démocratie et notre capacité à vivre ensemble, il est primordial de réfléchir à la manière dont l'architecture peut ouvrir la voie vers de nouveaux agencements du réel.
Ces agencements doivent échapper à une vision binaire et simpliste du monde pour mieux se confronter à sa complexité.
Les questionnements qui traversent notre époque - la crise climatique, les questions d'identité, la place de la vérité, .- appellent un engagement qui s'adresse à la fois à la multiplicité et au temps long.
Un engagement qui se confronte ainsi à la tension féconde entre spécificité et universalité.Pour continuer de questionner l'architecture de manière critique et la réévaluer, esthétiquement et politiquement, à la lumière de ce contexte contemporain, nous poursuivrons ce semestre notre investigation du concept d'hétérotopie énoncé par le philosophe français Michel Foucault.
Non pas avec la prétention de faire de la philosophie en tant que telle, mais afin de comprendre comment une philosophie peut nous aider à penser notre propre discipline et ses attendus, dès lors que nous l'abordons avec nos regards d'architectes.Michel Foucault a été un penseur pionnier dans la mise en relation de plans de réalité que personne ne connectait avant lui.
Il a su montrer que le progrès technique, les modes de constitution de la connaissance, la morale, le comptage du temps, la mesure de l'espace, la perception et le statut de nos corps eux-mêmes étaient liés au sein de notre organisation sociale.
L'étude de leurs évolutions respectives, subtilement entrelacées, met en lumière des enjeux de pouvoir jusqu'alors insoupçonnés, dont la conscience nourrit, désormais, largement la pensée contemporaine.Le concept d'hétérotopie, qu'il a énoncé en 1966 et qui s'apparente à des utopies construites et localisées, appartient à la description de ces ensembles jusqu'alors inconnus.
Il nous intéresse, en tant qu'architectes, à deux titres principaux.
D'une part, car il défini-t une catégorie nouvelle à partir de l'énoncé d'un critère - l'utopie construite en l'occurrence.
Une telle démarche est une sorte de métaphore du projet architectural qui, lui aussi, gagne à se livrer à la révision de concepts ou types connus par l'énonciation préalable de critères.
D'autre part, car l'hétérotopie se situe à l'intersection immédiate de l'espace, de l'organisation sociale et de l'imagination collective, soulignant ainsi la dimension, par définition, politique de tout acte architectural.
Sarcelles, hétérotopiqueC'est donc à partir du concept d'hétérotopie que nous travaillerons au semestre de printemps pour imaginer la transformation d'immeubles existants de la ville de Sarcelles.
En effet, le concept foucaldien résonne particulièrement avec ce grand ensemble de la taille d'une ville (12 000 logements) construit en vingt ans dans le nord du Grand Paris.
Tant par sa taille que par la cohérence formelle de ses différentes parties, la ville de Sarcelles se distingue de nombreux grands ensembles par sa capacité à produire une ville moderne vivante et pas une simple juxtaposition de logements.Les architectes du projet, Henri Boileau (1909-1989) et Jacques-Henri Labourdette (1915-2003), appartenaient à une tradition d'architectes modernes qui, à l'instar de Fernand Pouillon (1912-1986), avaient été formés par le pionnier du logement moderne Eugène Beaudoin (1898-1983).
Cette tradition se caractérise par un intérêt particulier pour la relation entre les pleins et les vides, entre les bâtiments et la qualité des espaces qu'ils produisent entre eux, et une reconnaissance de la qualité des espaces délimités.
C'est cette qualité que l'on retrouve à Sarcelles, comme dans les réalisations de Fernand Pouillon, telles que l'ensemble de logements du Point du Jour à Boulogne, que Boileau et Labourdette ont achevé après l'incarcération de leur auteur.Un regard attentif aux qualités matérielles et sensibles existantes sera le point de départ de notre recherche de projet.
Depuis de nombreuses années, l'Agence Nationale de la Rénovation Urbaine (ANRU), est en charge de l'aménagement des quartiers de grands ensembles.
Mue par une incompréhension crasse des attendus de la ville moderne et aveugle à toute reconnaissance de ses qualités ou potentiels, l'ANRU manie l'arme de la démolition à tout va.
À Sarcelles, notamment, elle a démoli des immeubles construits en pierre de taille pour les remplacer par des plots en béton isolés par l'extérieur, sans aucun égard ni pour les coûts, tant sociaux qu'environnementaux d'une telle politique.
Notre travail de studio vise clairement, comme nous l'avons déjà fait l'en dernier, à proposer des alternatives à la démolition en exprimant tout le potentiel que ces bâtiments et ces formes urbaines ont, sans pour autant ignorer leurs limites.
Nous projèterons des transformations qui amplifieront le caractère hétérotopique des lieux.
Contrairement au premier semestre, où nous avions envisagé la création d'un habitat à destination de communautés ultra-spécifiques, il s'agira ici de penser des lieux de vie, certes toujours avec une organisation spatiale précise et des usages spécifiques, mais capable de bénéficier et de s'adresser au cette fois au plus grand nombre.
Ce faisant, nous réfléchirons aux tensions fertiles qui se nouent entre la spécificité de l'espace domestique et sa capacité à accueillir des habitants encore inconnus, qui est au cœur de la conception du logement :
« La maison à loyer est le lieu commun de l'architecture, lieu commun qui doit briller par le sens commun.
Elle doit convenir à la foule, non à la façon d'une mode éphémère, mais à titre d'installation invariablement confortable et décente.
» disait déjà César Daly, théoricien de l'haussmannisme, au milieu du XIXe siècle.
Les hétérotopies de Sarcelles ne requerront plus une appartenance à une communauté spécifique (le retrait du monde commun pour faire apparaître de nouveaux mondes en propre), mais devront remettre en jeu un mouvement d'ouverture et de reconquête d'un monde en partage.
Nous imaginons que cela passe par une réflexion - allant jusqu'à l'inversion - sur les mouvements respectivement centripètes des espaces de l'intime et centrifuges des espaces du collectif.Concrètement, des objets domestiques appartenant traditionnellement au logement acqerront dans les projets une dimension collective qui leur permettent d'être partagés au delà du foyer.
En quittant ce dernier, ces objets-espaces re-configureront les typologies, les usages, les habitudes et les rituels pour des habitants nouveaux et déjà présents dans les immeubles de Sarcelles.
Nous explorerons l'hypothèse d'un bâtiment transformé par l'hypertrophie positive d'un de ses usages domestiques.
Que serait un logement informé, avant tout, par l'imaginaire et les nécessités de la chambre à coucher?
Ou par l'imaginaire et les nécessités de cuisine?
De la salle de bains?
Du séjour?
Et ainsi de suite.
Mais aussi, que serait un bâtiment entier conçu suivant de tels principes?
Un prétexte pour repenser, réévaluer, remettre en cause, la question de la fonctionnalité ou de la mono fonctionnalité, d'une part, mais aussi de devenir plus conscients des imaginaires et nécessités attachés à chacune des pièces de l'habitation conçue de manière traditionnelle.
Le tout en confrontation avec la vie et la question du logement, de ses usages, et des structures familiales qui les occupent, etc.
Nous imaginerons ainsi les implications concrètes d'un tel changement au sein d'une série de barres existantes afin de créer de nouveaux standards spatiaux, typologiques, et sociaux.
Enfin et tel que nous l'avons initié au semestre d'automne 2024, nous développerons un mode de présentation des projets qui porte en lui-même une dimension hétérotopique, c'est-à-dire capable de condenser espace et temps à l'intérieur d'un même support et d'ouvrir le dessin d'architecture au mouvement du récit.
Ce mode de présentation repose sur un dispositif simple et ouvert à la manipulation :
un ensemble de pages A4 assemblées entre elles et formant une grille.
Ces pages fermées forment une première grande image du projet et derrière celle-ci s'ouvre une multitude de fenêtres sur différents aspects du projet.
Ces fenêtres peuvent s'ouvrir encore, à la manière d'une poupée-russe de papier, pour démultiplier les points de vue et offrir un approfondissement spatial et temporel supplémentaire à cette architecture-monde.
Explorations parallèlesEn parallèle du travail hétérotopique de projet, deux explorations plus théoriques viendront nourrir l'expérience du studio.
Tout d'abord, un travail de production d'images permettra de documenter une série d'hétérotopies reprenant les catégories originelles de Foucault.
Cela permettra de constituer un répertoire de références communes et contribuera à nourrir l'imaginaire formel et conceptuel du collectif que nous constituerons durant ce semestre.Par ailleurs, les étudiants se pencheront précisément sur les deux retranscriptions des conférences où Michel Foucault élabore le concept d'hétérotopies.
Ces deux textes, rédigés à un an d'intervalle, entre 1966 et 1967, présentent un certain nombre de différences qu'il s'agira de relever et d'analyser de manière critique.
Cette recherche sera l'occasion de se familiariser avec le concept et d'en cerner les potentiels et les limites.Ces deux explorations théoriques - les images d'hétérotopies et la comparaison critique des deux textes de Foucault - seront regroupées au sein d'un fascicule qui constituera une des productions collectives du studio pour le jury final.Un voyage à Paris sera organisé afin de visiter Sarcelles mais aussi une série de bâtiments significatifs et en relation avec le concept d'hétérotopie.
Ce voyage sera ainsi l'occasion d'éprouver le plaisir de partager collectivement l'expérience de l'architecture selon un plan de coupe singulier sur le réel.Les deux premiers jours du studio seront un séminaire de lancement où l'équipe enseignante et des invités délivreront une série de conférences consacrées à toutes sortes de questions en lien avec le projet, des plus conceptuelles aux plus prosaïques.
Intervenir dans l'existant nécessite méthodes et outils spécifiques.
Leur maîtrise permet de comprendre ce qui est déjà là.
Rendu intelligible par une étude patrimoniale, l'existant peut être réhabilité.
La réhabilitation s'étend de la restauration à la création, en passant par la transformation.
La mise au jour du potentiel d'un bâti existant, qu'il soit protégé ou ordinaire, implique son étude préalable.
Il s'agit donc tout d'abord de s'approprier les méthodes et les outils spécifiques de l'étude patrimoniale.
Leur maîtrise, à laquelle tend à initier cet enseignement, participe d'une meilleure compréhension de ce qui est déjà là, en vue d'une éventuelle intervention.
Il s'agit également de prendre conscience que cette étude constitue une part intégrante du projet et pas seulement une phase liminaire, dépourvue d'intentions conceptuelles.
L'étude patrimoniale intègre le relevé de l'existant, son étude historique et sa critique d'authenticité ainsi que son diagnostic technique et sanitaire.
La mener à bien suppose d'adopter une démarche pluridisciplinaire en impliquant des spécialistes tels que des ingénieurs, des entreprises et des chercheurs.
Cette phase d'étude constitue également une opportunité de s'interroger sur les modes de représentation de l'architecture et du paysage.
Par ailleurs, il est important de rappeler que l'ensemble de ces méthodes et outils ne constitue pas seulement un corpus figé de procédés expérimentés mais bien un champ de recherche contemporain, expérimental et continu.
Seule une réactivation par l'usage peut assurer la pérennité de l'existant.
La reprogrammation constitue à ce titre une phase de réflexion préalable et indispensable à la réhabilitation.
Viennent ensuite les différents types d'intervention dans l'existant, de la restauration à la création, en passant par la transformation.
Ces derniers ne doivent pas être déterminés a priori mais résulter des conclusions de l'étude patrimoniale, en particulier de celles relatives à la valeur patrimoniale de l'existant.
Le potentiel du patrimoine ne se révèle concrètement qu'à travers ces interventions.
Pour servir au présent, l'existant peut ainsi nécessiter une restauration, totale ou partielle, impliquer une transformation d'une de ses parties, voire exiger une création, sous la forme d'une extension par exemple.
De plus, au-delà du type d'intervention, se pose la question du parti pris.
En effet, chacun de ces types se décline pour participer au mieux à un projet cohérent.
Ces interventions doivent être contextualisées (c'est-à-dire définies par rapport au site, aux matériaux, aux mises en œuvre, etc.) et inscrites parmi celles de nombreux partenaires (ingénieurs et entreprises spécialisés).
L'intervention dans l'existant est une pratique ancienne bien que résolument contemporaine, en phase avec les enjeux écologiques et sociaux d'aujourd'hui.
L'obsolescence fonctionnelle du bâti constitue une problématique qui sous-tend l'ensemble des situations exposées pendant le cours.
Elle doit attirer notre attention sur la capacité d'adaptation de ce qui est déjà là (l'existant) et de ce que nous construisons.
Cette adaptabilité s'entend bien sûr sur le plan programmatique mais également sur le plan environnemental, face au dérèglement climatique.
Le constat de ses effets doit nous responsabiliser et nous pousser à agir, en se saisissant par exemple du patrimoine comme d'une ressource et un point d'appui générateur de projet.
Finalement, l'objectif de cet enseignement est de partager et de débattre d'une conviction, celle du potentiel du patrimoine.
Ce faisant, il s'agit de mettre chacun en position de pouvoir exalter pleinement, et consciemment à travers ses futurs projets, le potentiel du déjà-là.
This course explores visual strategies and techniques for creating apparent reality.
The course concentrates on the field of 3D computer graphics and the production of still lifes as computer-generated images (CGI).
In the first theoretical part of the course, various concepts and methods involving analogue and digital image-generation techniques are introduced and compared.
The focus is on the seemingly realistic image.
Historical references and examples of artworks from the fields of painting, photography and computer graphics aid further investigation and are examined with regard to various aspects of visual aesthetics.
The second part of the course addresses 3D computer graphics.
Students receive an introduction to the 3D graphics program Blender (or Cinema 4D), which serves as the foundation for developing a series of computer-generated still lifes as their final project The aim is to examine the extent to which atmospheric visual aesthetics can be created using computer-generated images - visual aesthetics which, although based on a photographic language, have an expressiveness capable of overcoming the often lifeless and cool visual language seen in examples of calculated images.
The course encourages the use of digital instruments at the extreme limit of the interplay between reality and fiction.
This course focuses on the production of utopian scenarios using experimental composition techniques.
By means of digital montage, the fictitious scenes are meaningfully conveyed in a series of images.
The module will focus on working with experimental and visual composition techniques.
The main interest lies in the visual connecting and rearranging of what is seemingly incompatible - visual constructs that have little to do with reality.
The module offered is divided into two main parts.
In the first part, the participants develop a series of perspective and illusory image compositions on the computer, based on unconventional rearrangement of found photographic visual elements.
In the second part of the module, objects and architectural components are questioned and reinterpreted according to their characteristics and translated into seemingly real objects on the basis of digital image-processing techniques.
During the course of the semester, the participants will develop a pictorial work comprising several images - on the basis of the content communicated in the lectures, the workshops and the assignments that are continuously given.
The course encourages the use of manual and digital instruments at the extreme limit of the interplay between reality and fiction.
This course addresses the subject of moving images.
It focuses on the field of 3D computer graphics and the animation of computer-generated images (CGI).
The starting point for this module comprises the various spaces that we spend time in daily, along with their objects and the mobile everyday items that surround us.
By means of short film and animation sequences, a subtle still life, an excerpt from everyday life, is to be poetically captured:
an observed or arranged choreography of objects in a space, as affected by dynamically active influencing factors such as light and shadow, gravity, wind, temperature, sound, or those generated by mechanical forces.
The module offered is divided into two main parts.
In the first part, the participants observe or arrange individual dynamic still lifes from their daily environment and create a series of poetic close-ups on this basis, in the form of short film sequences that are captured with a camera or mobile phone.
In the second part of the module, the real scenes are reconstructed three-dimensionally on a computer and conveyed as animation.
The students are given a full introduction to the 3D program Blender (or Cinema 4D), on which basis they create a series of expressive computer animations as their final project.
The course encourages the use of digital instruments at the extreme limit of the interplay between reality and fiction.
L'objectif est de restituer la centralité des réseaux, en identifiant tant les raisons culturelles que les enjeux matériels du « projet du confort » dans le « projet d'architecture ».
L'enseignement se situe à la croisée des disciplines de la construction, de l'histoire et de la sauvegarde.
Matériaux et techniques novateurs, mais aussi systÚmes et procédés industriels inédits :
si la «révolution constructive » qui s'opÚre au XXe siÚcle est amplement reconnue par l'histoire de l'architecture, les dispositifs du confort, qui en font pleinement partie, restent un thÚme le plus souvent négligé, pour ne pas dire simplement ignoré.
Et pourtant, les dispositifs passifs et les dispositifs actifs jouent une relation de véritable interdépendance dans le bâti :
gaines savamment mises en couleur qui participent à l'expression des intérieurs « brutalistes » ;
serpentins d'eau chaude incorporés dans l'épaisseur du plancher confortant la conception du « plan libre » ;
aérothermes et radiateurs qui se transfigurent en partitions ou alors disparaissent dans les interstices des enveloppes.
Dissimulés, incorporés, ou alors exposés, voire littéralement mis en scÚne, ces réseaux de chauffage, ventilation, conditionnement de l'air qui sont paradoxalement encombrants mais souvent invisibles, méritent une nouvelle considération comme des éléments réellement structurants, et non pas et oh combien à tort comme des simples composants rapportés, voire accessoires.
Les hypothÚses des pionniers, de James Marston Fitch à Reyner Banham, demeurent d'une impressionnante pertinence ;
saisir les implications du « projet du climat » dans le « projet d'architecture » par une lecture transversale située à la croisée du sensible et du matériel, ouvre des voies d'interprétation extrêmement significatives de l'architecture moderne et contemporaine.
Structuré autour de quelques thÚmes fondateurs de cette production d'envergure de l'industrialisation du bâtiment, aux notions de légÚrété et transparence ce panorama permet aussi de cerner les raisons culturelles du « design du climat » et du contrÎle artificiel de l'ambiance intérieure, une pratique qui traverse le XXe siÚcle et influence trÚs directement la conception architecturale autant que sa mise en oeuvre matérielle, les deux aspects étant indissociables.
Qu'il s'agisse d'une démarche qui souhaite exploiter le potentiel environnemental du bâti dans son contexte, ou d'une approche raisonnée qui tire parti des sources renouvelables grâce à une panoplie de dispositifs passifs économes en énergie, les expérimentations menées au siÚcle passé gardent une actualité certaine.
galement, les nouveaux paradigmes d'économie d'énergie démontrent la centralité de la notion de bien-être matériel dans sa nouvelle acception de « confort global ».
Ils seront traités en relation à la question cruciale de l'adaptation du bâti existant aux standards actuels par des interventions ciblées sur les installations techniques.
Expérimenter les moyens graphiques de re-présentation de l'architecture.
Exercer la compétence de communiquer par ces moyens.
Par une pratique répétée exerçant les relations œil, main, cerveau;
par une réflexion issue des théories de la représentation;
par la recherche de solutions inventives.
L'UE est structurée entre plusieurs apports d'histoire et théorie de la représentation et des travaux pratiques où sont expérimentées, au mieux de leurs spécificités et dans l'esprit de médias mixtes, plusieurs techniques de représentation de l'architecture comme par exemple :
les techniques de dessin à la main, la gravure en relief (sur bois, plastique, linoléum), le gaufrage, la gravure en creux à la pointe sèche, la photographie et l'infographie.
This UE explores more in details, and in a more practical way, the concepts introduced during the BIM introduction course AR-484.
All project different phases are addressed, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and data exchanges.
This Teaching Unit is an introduction to a series of knowlege and issues at stake, necessary and critical, in an evolving practice of the architectural projetc at a global scale.
Understanding and mastering these knowledge and technologies within a semester, thanks to a series of exercices applied to a case study of small scale, would allow for practical reuse and implementation in future projects.
The case study is a bus stop shelter project conceived and realized by Richter Dahl Rocha & Associés at Ecublens, Abribus RC1 and with whom we will be in direct exchange during the semester.
The content of the unit is organised along the three first phases of an architectural project.
Each session consists in an introductory lecture of 30 minutes and followed by applied exercices on the same topic.
Each phase will enriched by one or two lectures from an external personality.

L'UE vise à sensibiliser les étudiants aux enjeux d'un projet de réhabilitation.
Elle se concentre sur les rapports entre les impératifs liés à la réhabilitation et à une vision architecturale élargie, avec un accent particulier sur le développement durable.
Etudes de cas comprenant des immeubles de logement en situation réelle sur lesquels on appliquera, dans une première étape, une démarche d'analyse et d'expertise, suivie d'un diagnostic et d'un concept global d'intervention.
Dans une deuxième phase, des mesures d'intervention à travers une approche interdisciplinaire inciteront à étudier et présenter des propositions en relation avec une matérialisation des intentions architecturales.
Dans ce cadre, l'étudiant/e procèdera à la vérification des solutions choisies en s'appuyant notamment sur des logiciels spécifiques.
Ce cours s'articule autour de la conception en équipe d'un équipement sportif temporaire.
La démarche pédagogique s'appuiera sur une approche de design intégré, appliquée à la conception et l'évaluation d'un espace de représentation scénique en milieu urbain.
Ce cours s'organise autour d'un projet développé en groupe.
L'objectif sera de concevoir un équipement sportif temporaire, lequel intègre les principes du "surcyclage" en suivant une série d'étapes itératives.
Un processus de conception qui permettra aux étudiants d'appliquer des critères de durabilité et d'évaluer quantitativement et qualitativement les performances de leur projet.
Pour ce faire, les étudiants seront amenés à analyser, simuler et vérifier les propriétés du théâtre développé en termes de charge écologique et de confort des usagers, au regard du système constructif qu'ils auront choisi.
Ce processus itératif permettra aux étudiants de se familiariser avec les stratégies durables implémentées dans le processus de conception architecturale ainsi que d'appréhender la complexité d'une démarche multicritère.
This class offers an overview about comfort evaluations in architectural design and suggests passive and low-energy strategies suited to ensure the highest possible indoor environment quality for buildings.
This course addresses occupant comfort, its evaluation and the relevant architectural and technological strategies to achieve a high level of comfort in indoor spaces.
The course is structured as follows:
Theory lectures:
Introduction to the various indoor comfort requirements in buildings and their evaluation:
thermal, visual and acoustical comfort and air quality.
Comfort standards and metrics are introduced, as well as passive design strategies and the main energy targets to be met using active (mechanical) systems when passive systems are not sufficient to ensure adequate indoor comfort conditions.
Main building physics principles are illustrated as well as their application in emblematic existing buildings.
The theoretical lectures will be complemented by the introduction into suitable software tools to calculate and evaluate the indoor comfort and main energy parameters.The theory lectures pertaining to Acoustics and Air Quality will be given as guest lectures by established experts in these fields, respectively by Dr.
Hervé Lissek, head of the acoustic group at LTS2 and Prof.
Dusan Licina, director of the Human-Oriented Built Environment Laboratory (HOBEL).
Individual exercise:
Students will use and get familiar with the presented software tools by working individually on a pre-defined project.
This exercise will be accompanied by dedicated sessions supported by lecturers and teaching assistants.
Project exercise:
The students will work in groups on a small project and will have to evaluate and optimize a building under given comfort and energy requirements.
This group work will be accompanied by two 'desk critique' sessions, where the students will discuss the work and receive guidance from the teachers.
Ce cours adopte une démarche de déconstruction de la complexité urbaine pour aborder l'urbanisme et les territoires, en s'appuyant sur une méthode systémique.
Comme planificateur, aménagistes, ingenieur territorial, urbaniste, specialiste de l'urbain, pour guider et accompagner l'évolution du territoire, il est au préalable nécessaire de la comprendre dans sa complexité.
L'ambition du cours est de déconstruire cette complexité et de fournir des outils pour appréhender les origines et les processus à l'oeuvre dans la fabrique du territoire.
Nous partons d'une même question presque naïve :
« qui est le pilote de l'évolution du territoire pour ré-interroger successivement tous les mouvements à l'origine des évolutions du territoire.
L'objectif de ce tour d'horizon est ensuite de ré-articuler les différents mouvements observés par une étude de leurs relations et de dessiner une systémique.
Les différentes semaines s'articulent autour du triptique forme, pouvoir et usages, utilisé pour théoriser ples différents mouvements qui s'exercent sur le territoire.
Le cours ville et mobilité porte sur les savoirs de base sur la mobilité en partant des modes de vie pour informer l'architecture et l'ingénierie.
Il explore en particulier comment ville et mobilité se coconstruisent.
Les séances s'organisent en deux temps :
(1) une présentation théorique et conceptuelle des transformations récentes en matière de mobilité et, (2) la présentation d'une recherche ou étude portant sur la thématique de la séance.
Ce double positionnement permet ainsi aux étudiants d'accéder à un contenu conceptuel stabilisé et d'appréhender la «recherche en train de se faire».
Les séances abordent des questions de définition de la mobilité, des outils de mesure et de connaissance de la mobilité et des déplacements, des approches renouvelées en matière de choix modal, les liens entre mobilité et modes de vie urbains, et enfin l'action publique dans le domaine de la mobilité.
Centré sur les formes d'habitat des plus pauvres dans les pays du Sud et du Nord et les contextes de crises, en particulier les architectures d'urgence, le cours propose une analyse critique de l'urbanisation du monde au 21ème siècle.
Le cours invite les étudiant·e·s à penser, en circulant des pays du Sud vers les pays du Nord, les enjeux globaux et locaux de l'urbanisation, ainsi que le rôle des professionnel·le·s et des habitant·e·s dans la construction de leurs habitat et environnement.
Il interroge également la possibilité d'autres architectures à partir de cours théoriques et d'expériences de terrain relatées par les enseignant·e·s et leurs invité·e·s, entre autres au travers de projets s'inscrivant dans des contextes humanitaires et de développement, y compris celles liées aux mouvements migratoires actuels.
Le cours se déploie à partir de la notion de « subaltern housing policies » qui invite à interroger les conditions de logement et, plus largement, de vie des populations migrantes précaires qui se tiennent aux marges de l'État social et de la citoyenneté, autant dans les pays du Sud que du Nord.
Nous interrogerons ainsi la relation entre la production de formes d'habitat précaire et la production de catégories de personnes dont le statut de citoyen n'est pas pleinement reconnu.Se plaçant à la fois sur le plan conceptuel et sur celui de la recherche appliquée, en mettant en regard les apports théoriques des chercheur·e·s et les réalisations faites par les différent·e·s acteurs et actrices sociales et politiques, du gouvernement ou non, mais aussi les plus alternatives et rebelles, le cours propose aux étudiant·e·s de procéder à leur propre analyse critique (c'est-à-dire (géo)politique) des mécanismes de production de l'habitat urbain.
Pour cela, il propose d'aller à la rencontre d'autres processus d'urbanisation sur les « bas-côtés » des sociétés urbaines, pour en comprendre la complexité et le rapport aux contextes.
L'UE J initie les étudiant·es à l'analyse urbaine et territoriale à la lumière d'une hypothèse de recherche.
Une séquence d'opérations est proposée:
relevé/description;
identification de principes spatiaux (formes/rationalités/dynamiques);
esquisse de visions territoriales.

Vers une culture des lieux L'injonction à la densification selon le principe du "développement vers l'intérieur", inscrit dans la Loi d'Aménagement du Territoire depuis 2013, semble désormais intégrée par tous les acteurs de l'urbanisme et de la construction - architectes, administrations, clients, opérateurs immobiliers, experts.
Dans la perspective d'une croissance démographique en Suisse, le développement vers l'intérieur oriente l'urbanisme des villes-centre majeures et des agglomérations.
Toutefois, en s'inscrivant dans une approche qui oppose densité vs.
mitage, il se révèle inadéquat au sujet des structures territoriales villageoises en tant que forme d'urbanisation discontinue en milieu rural.
L'urgence de questionner les modalités d'une évolution appropriée des territoires de villages va de pair avec l'urgence de rendre compte de leurs dynamiques réelles ainsi que des attentes sociales.
Dominés par l'espace non bâti et caractérisés par une socialité de proximité, ces territoires ont vu leur attractivité se consolider en contexte de crise sanitaire et climatique.
Les structures villageoises représentent un atout en vue de l'évolution durable du territoire car elles présentent des ressources de régulation climatique, environnementale et sociale qui sont limitées dans les villes-centres ;
en même temps, elles présentent des fragilités, notamment au niveau de la mobilité ou des performances énergétiques.
L'appel lancé par la politique fédérale de la Baukultur (Déclaration de Davos de 2018) au nom des "lieux" et contre une approche des standards ou des modèles préétablis, revêt une pertinence particulière.
En vue d'une croissance démographique des villages, quelle culture du bâti serait-elle non seulement compatible mais aussi profitable à une transition environnementale, énergétique, modale et, plus largement, sociale?
Quelles futures densités pourraient prendre forme sur la base d'un rapport au lieu compris sous tous ses registres - matériel, spatial, culturel, fonctionnel et social?
Quelle culture d'une densité optimale prendrait le dessus sur la tentation simpliste d'une densité maximale?
Quels imaginaires peuvent orienter une vision de l'urbanisation des villages aux prises avec un projet de société pour la transition?
Etude de cas Le cours est organisé par le Laboratoire d'Urbanisme de l'EPFL et l'Institut d'architecture TRANSFORM (patrimoine, construction et usages) de l'HEIA, Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et d'Architecture de Fribourg.
Il se concentre sur l'urbanisation discontinue villageoise dans le canton de Fribourg, notamment dans les régions situées en dehors des périmètres d'agglomération mais marquées par une croissance démographique positive.
Dans un premier temps, il s'agira de faire état des multiples lectures et interprétations de ce territoire, parfois divergentes entre elles, qui ont inspiré la planification officielle.
Ensuite, le renouvellement du regard exigé par l'exposition accrue aux risques climatiques, environnementaux et sociaux, sera poursuivi grâce à une analyse morphologique et quantitative visant à dévoiler les caractères et dynamiques des structures territoriales et spatiales villageoises.
Les étudiants mettront ainsi au point une cartographie qui, tout en prenant appui sur les données cartographiques officielles, revisite les catégories conventionnelles de l'urbanisme fonctionnaliste - habiter, travailler, circuler, se recréer - à l'aune des nouvelles conditions de l'ainsi dite "transition".
Alors que les anciennes catégories étaient au service d'un urbanisme de modèles reproductibles, les nouvelles cartes constitueront autant de portraits exploratoires en mesure de faire émerger d'autres, différents futurs.
Teaching unit on cartography and environmental aesthetics in architecture.
Maps are visual tools for thinking about the world at many scales.
They shape scientific hypotheses, organize political and military power, delineate private property, and reflect mental conceptions about landscapes and nonhuman nature.
We carry them around in our phones and use them all the time, but maps are as banal as they are complicated.
Cartography serves many purposes and historically it has meant different things.
Medieval maps, for example, were conceptual cosmologies that could include mythology and history, flora and fauna, exotic peoples and species.
With the advent of modernity, Cartesian perspectives began to trace the world in relation to a fixed subject, while mathematical God's eye views surveyed the land from an abstract elevated 'nowhere'.
Accurate maps, stripped of all elements of fantasy, religion, and authorship, became essential tools for scholars and states seeking progress through scientific prediction, social engineering and planning.
Cartography became synonymous with the land survey.
Modernity required the invention of "space as emptiness, as a universal receptacle in which objects exist and events occur, as a frame of reference, a coordinate system".
But the flip side of treating the environment as an abstract container is treating architecture as an abstract object, disembedded and aestheticized for its own sake.
From this radical separation, maps become quantitative systems for managing phenomena, while buildings become 'circulating' commodities for the valorization of land rent.
But the environment is not a neutral backdrop, just as architecture is not a mere collection of icons.
Buildings and landscapes constitute each other dialectically, whether in collaboration or antagonism.
This teaching unit proposes a method for critically embedding architecture.
By mapping buildings in their space and time, we reveal their material conditions of possibility.
The aesthetic choices conveyed in the so-called 'object' thus appear no longer disinterested, but complex, as a rich totality of environmental relations.
Throughout the semester, students will consider the following questions:
how does architecture reflect a social relation to the environment, should it constitute a critique of said relation, and can it project a collective ideal?

Experience Design examines the effects of digitalization on architectural typologies in the contemporary city.
The course questions traditional typologies by focusing on an understanding and re-design of social, geographic, temporal and emotional experiences.
At the dawn of the generative AI revolution, circa.
2022, techno-utopian narratives painted an imminent future where people would shed their skins evolving from citizens into "netizens" driven by neoliberal ideals of relentless efficiency, limitless productivity, and optimized convenience.
These scenarios envisioned a society mediated entirely by digital platforms, where education becomes personalized via AI-driven learning ecosystems, social interactions shift into immersive virtual worlds, and essential services from healthcare to retail evolve into transactional, data-harvesting exchanges.
Yet, while digital experiences have undeniably transformed fundamental aspects of our everyday lives--learning, working, banking, healing, meeting, and shopping--the physical world remains central and essential.
People still deeply crave sensory experiences, social interactions, and tangible engagements.
As AI and digital infrastructures continue to infiltrate our built environments, the physical and virtual realms are increasingly merging, spawning entirely novel architectural typologies.
The seminar UE X / Experience Design challenges students to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries and cultivate a holistic understanding of experience design as a critical tool for shaping future architectures.
Which traditional spaces and building types become obsolete or profoundly altered by digital transitions?
How do architectural and urban concepts of space evolve as new interactive elements emerge?
What new experiences and typologies are enabled by merging physical and digital realms?
Employing critical experience design methodologies, the course involves:
(1) mapping social dynamics surrounding a lived experience, emphasizing the relational over the transactional;
(2) critically analyzing geographical and temporal flows (experience journeys);
and (3) carefully redesigning experience touchpoints to foreground humanistic values of care, presence, and agency.
Each year, the seminar examines a specific information-intensive typology vulnerable to obsolescence, such as museums, libraries, airports, banks, boutiques, parliaments, universities, hospitals, homes.
Digital interfaces (apps) and augmented physical artifacts will be explored as tools to meaningfully redistribute sensory perception, re-humanize experiences of time, and reconfigure social, emotional, and spatial interactions.
Students from ENAC and IC collaborate in a genuine interdisciplinary dialogue.

Political Economy of Design (PED) seeks to position and discuss architecture in relation to the world of production, economic interests and community benefits or decisions, at a local and global scale.
PED 2025 focuses on 'power' and how it can affect the space of architecture as a discipline.
By integrating yet moving beyond the stylistic, technological or sociological aspects of the latter, the discussion reviews the industrial elements that are likely to affect programmatic objectives, formal directions and technical outcomes of building projects.
Such discussion has a strong comparative bent, and is coloured by the notion of innovation - what it means from a social, technical and cultural point of view, and how it enters and affects different building markets.
Attention is directed at understanding the distinction between innovation on one side and invention and technological change on the other.
In this context, architecture's connection with planning and building disciplines is examined and criticised in the attempt to formulate a strategic framework for its use as an environmental policy instrument.
Ce cours a pour objectif de familiariser les étudiants à la sociologie urbaine à partir du prisme du logement.
Il permet de naviguer entre les concepts, outils et méthodes qu'elle propose pour penser l'évolution concomitante des modes de vie et de l'organisation spatiale et politique du territoire.
Le cours aborde les concepts et outils de la sociologie urbaine à travers le prisme du logement, en explorant la manière dont les questions les plus intimes du chez soi se lient aux enjeux les plus politiques de l'habitat.
Ce prisme permet ainsi de se familiariser avec les outils théoriques et méthodologiques de la sociologie urbaine, tout en développant un regard critique sur le logement en tant que point d'articulation matériel et expérientiel des enjeux politiques et sociaux qui accompagnent le développement d'une société urbaine.
Traité comme un fait social total, l'habitat permet d'offrir un regard critique, et empiriquement fondé, sur les grands enjeux de société traités par la sociologie tels que l'évolution des formes familiales et des modes de vie, la transformation du rapport au travail, les inégalités de genre ou encore les métamorphoses de l'Etat et du capitalisme.
Dans cette perspective, le cours s'articule autour de trois grands axes:
Familiarisation à la sociologie urbaine et à ses méthodes Introduction des acteur.ice.s et des enjeux qui accompagnent les politiques de l'habitat Introduction de la notion d'habiter et regard sur l'expérience intime de l'habitat et ses contradictions Le cours se construit autour de contributions théoriques proposées à la fois par l'équipe enseignante ainsi que des intervenant.e.s invité.e.s et d'un travail de terrain collectif.
Concrètement, chaque étudiant·e analysera, à l'aide des différents outils d'enquête et d'analyse abordés en cours (revue de presse, observation, entretien..), un phénomène urbain lié à l'habitat (rénovation, transformation, densification, démolition...).
Le but est à la fois de s'approprier les méthodes et les enjeux de la production de matériaux sociologiques, et de confronter les éléments théoriques du cours à des cas concrets.
Des séances d'atelier permettront de discuter l'évolution des travaux de groupe.
Le but est d'avancer progressivement dans la constitution d'une présentation finale qui constituera un premier mode d'évaluation du cours.
Ce travail collectif servira ensuite de base pour un examen écrit individuel qui invitera les étudiant.e.s à mettre en dialogue les cas d'étude enquêtés et analysés avec des éléments théoriques, concepts et lectures abordés en cours.
Au final, le cours doit permettre de construire une lecture indissociablement expérientielle, sociale et politique des formes contemporaines de l'habitat une lecture qui permet de placer les savoirs de l'architecture au coeur d'une critique sociale.
Ce cours basé sur un MOOC prépare à l'analyse du contexte économique du projet de construction :
acquisition du terrain, prix fonciers, prix immobiliers, prix du logement (locatif et en propriété), dans le cadre urbain.
À la fin du cours, l'étudiant.e comprendra les déterminants de ces prix.

Cours de cadrage destiné à appréhender les questions de répartition spatiale des hommes et des activités d'un point de vue historique Il s'agit, en s'appuyant sur des exemples concrets, d'essayer de déterminer quels sont les facteurs qui influencent la répartitions spatiale des activités humaines, et, à l'inverse, comment ces répartitions spatiales viennent à influencer la manière dont la population réside et se déplace.
Les modèles classiques de répartition des activités (Von Thünen, Weber, Christaller, Alonso-Muth) seront présentés, ainsi que des résultats de recherche plus récents sur les formes d'organisation du territoire dont bien souvent la répartition des activités économiques donne la trame et constitue le squelette.

We are living in an urban world and the design of sustainable cities is essential in order to decrease our energy footprint.
This course provides the instruments to understand the complex urban metabolism, as well as the solutions for planning future smart and sustainable cities.
We live in a world that is more and more urbanised (over 50% of the world population lives in cities since 2010) and architects, urban planners and other stakeholders have to rethink their projects to integrate them to an urban context.
In the architecture curriculum at the Bachelor and Master level, students have been introduced to the fundamentals and principles of building science as well as other courses that focus on the urban scale.
However, none of these courses focus on the physics behind metabolism and sustainability of future districts and cities.
The objective of this course is to provide the instruments to understand and to quantify the urban metabolism, focusing on the urban climate, the buildings energy design and the liveability of the spaces between buildings.
The class introduces the concept of circular economy and its applications to building design, with a focus on design with reused components and design for disassembly.
The class develops critical thinking skills over and above theoretical and technical inputs.
Circular economy consists in maintaining and/or improving the value of products as long as possible, i.e.
by extending or renewing their service live while minimizing resource depletion, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions.
When it comes to building design, a series of sometimes contradicting strategies emerges:
to limit the quantity of used materials, to limit their ecological impact, to enhance the versatility of buildings, and to ensure the future repair, reuse, or recycling of their components.
The class delves into recent literature and practice, aiming at providing the necessary expertise to adopt these strategies in a pragmatic state of mind.
The following themes punctuate the semester:
Circular Economy:
History & Principles Environmental Footprint of Buildings Waste & Recycling Reuse Assessment, Deconstruction & Procurement processes Design for Upstream Reuse (Resuing Structural and Non-Structural Components) Design for Downstream Reuse (Design for Disassembly, Reversible Design, Design for Flexibility, Modular Design) Design with Geo-based Materials New Circual Business Models and Legal Aspects
The course is part of a three-year trajectory dedicated to a comprehensive history of domestic space.
This year the course will be devoted to the origins of domestic space, from hunter-gatherer forms of life to the rise of private property.
The Origins of Domestic Space Professor Pier Vittorio Aureli The course is part of a three-year trajectory dedicated to a comprehensive history of domestic space and its relationship with urban form from its prehistoric origins to neoliberal times.
This year the course will be devoted to the origins of domestic space, from hunter-gatherer forms of life to the rise of private property.
Besides being a commonplace of our everyday existence, domestic space is a complex and often contradictory sphere in which care and oppression are constantly intertwined.
While the term 'domestic' evokes a sense of familiarity and intimacy, its invention and development have often had more to do with government and power over subjects.
The word itself, domestic, comes from domus whose etymology is linked to the Greek root demi, to build;
yet, its many declensions gave origin to words such as dominion, domination, etc.
We can say that domestic space implies a vector of command over its subjects.
The question is why domestic space has become such a hegemonic form of life for the human species.
The answer to this question is neither simple nor obvious, and we should resist any fatalistic understanding of domesticity as an inevitable condition of humanity.
By studying the beginnings of domestic space, we can see how the process of sedentarization of the human species was far from being linear and instead consisted of a complex back-and-forth that involved a great range of place-making strategies.
This little-studied aspect of domesticity--especially in architectural education--casts a very important light on the history of domestic space and forces us to question many assumptions about the most ubiquitous kind of architecture, the house.
Indeed, the key goal of this course is not erudition in ancient history--although this is an important objective--but to challenge our presumed knowledge about things we take for granted, such as family relationships, the individuation of gender roles, and the hierarchical organization of societies in classes.
Above all, we'll go beyond dichotomies such as savage vs.
civilized or primitive vs.
advanced that to this day still plague architects' understanding of architecture and social formations.
The course will discuss examples from different parts of the world and will focus especially on the relationship between architecture, class, and gender relationships.
A very important focus of the lectures will be what the archaeologist Richard Bradley has called the 'ritualization of life,' a reading that expands the concept of ritual far beyond our current understanding that limits the idea of ritual to the sphere of the sacred.
On the contrary, ritualistic behavior was one of the most important aspects of human existence and perhaps the fundamental link between the human being and architectural form.
Another important aspect that will be discussed is the politics of domestic space and how its evolution is evidence of power relationships within ancient social groups.
For this reason, special attention will be given to the relationship between the house, its ecological context, the formation of settlements and in some case the development of cities.

The course introduces digital design and fabrication methods by combining the transfer of technical skills with theoretical knowledge and critical reflection.
Topics include:
scripting/programming for design, mass customisation through digital fabrication and robotic construction.
The goal of the course is to establish a critical understanding of available digital technologies and their impact on construction.
While students will learn technical skills, such as scripting, optimisation and robotic control, the course focus is on exploring the implications that these techniques have on design and construction so that in the future students can thoughtfully employ them based on their own interpretation and goals.
The course consists of four blocks each focusing on one central topic, in which we will investigate the role of digital tools on topics such as sustainability, construction labor, acceptance and bias, among others.
Topics covered:
- scripting for custom geometry generation - material and optimisation - robotic construction - artificial intelligence Each topic will be addressed through an introduction, a tutorial and a readings session and will include an exercise to be submitted at the beginning of the next block.
At the end of the course students will be asked to select and critically examine an example of a design or construction process in which digital tools have been used and to propose alternatives or extensions of the presented process to address one or more of the challenges identified in class.
Theory course on modernist environmental aesthetics in architecture.
"Happy are those ages", said Georg Lukacs, "when the starry sky is the map of all possible paths--ages whose paths are illuminated by the light of the stars.
Everything in such ages is new and yet familiar, full of adventure and yet their own." The world and the self are sharply distinct but never strangers, every action feels complete in sense and for the senses, reason and experience are one.
Modernity, on the other hand, is an age of separations.
No other period has been so densely connected, so thoroughly humanized, so artificially ours;
and yet, even the objects and institutions of our making appear abstract, technocratic, alienated.
For Lukacs, modernity signalled this historical loss of totality, a severance between the individual and the universal that art should attempt to (re)mediate.
In this wishful reconciliation, modern art would become "the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God." In Rousseau's modernity, individuals were "forced to be free." While the epic hero in premodern literature represented a collectivity, the hero of the modern metropolis is always solitary, problematical and must always stand in opposition to his setting, to nature or society.
Odysseus stood for, and with, Ithaca;
Baudelaire stands for, and by, himself--even as he strolls through the Parisian crowds.
So, too, is the architecture object.
Severed from the totality of the city, it must now set forth to "prove its soul" in the emptiness of the world.
Premodern architecture had totality as a given, the modern object seeks totality as an aim.
This course offers a critical history of architectural modernism by mapping crucial moments of this recurring debate over the interrelationship and opposition betweens the object and urban organization.
Each class pairs an architect with a concept of mediation, spanning from the nineteenth century to postmodernity.
The sequence is organized in four periods:
Bourgeois Utopias, Heroic Internationalism, Postwar Welfare, and Neoliberal Disenchantment.
Throughout the course, students will consider the following questions:
how does architecture reflect a social relation to the environment, should it constitute a critique of said relation, and can it project a collective ideal?

This course focuses on the circulation of the imaginary between cultures.
It shows how major Western architects, landscape designers, painters and sculptors have been inserting sustainable architectural and landscape Japanese devices and notions into their designs since the 19th century.
Firstly, the course provides an introduction, by seven lectures, to the major sources of inspiration, devices, and notions that 20th c.
Westerners selected when studying Japanese pre-modern architectural and landscape projects.
Secondly, students (group work-individual work on request) will propose a sustainable innovation grounded in a specific Japanese source of inspiration:
a device (tatami or shoji set, natural stone layout, etc.) or a notion (ma, miniaturisation, indirect light etc.), or combination of both.
They may also propose a technical transposition done with other materials and manufacturing techniques.

This course introduces theoretical developments and empirical evidence on city population change worldwide, as well as on its interactions with sustainable development.
Students will learn how to identify sociodemographic profiles of cities to better serve them.
Alongside fast socioeconomic and technological developments, the human population has grown significantly since 1980, from 4.4 to 8 billion in 2022, and its structure or composition has changed, thereby increasing its ecological footprint.
The world population got older, better educated, and more than half is concentrated in cities since 2015.
This course focuses on the human actors of the resulting change in the built and natural environments.
It introduces aspects of population change in cities that are relevant to architects, urban planners, civil and environmental engineers, as well as social scientists.
Students will learn how to identify and draw sociodemographic profiles of urban populations to better serve them.
The course puts the people at the heart of the urbanisation process:
for how many, where and for whom to build housing and infrastructure and provide public services?
Adopting a multiscale spatial perspective, the course offers an overview of theoretical developments and empirical evidence on the demographic dimensions of city growth, the transformation of city hierarchies, the processes of urban concentration, urban sprawl and re-urbanisation, and urban exclusion (segregation/slums).
Various questions will be addressed, such as:
Why is the majority of future world population growth expected to be concentrated in low- and middle-income countries' cities, despite low levels of fertility?
Will cities in high-income countries be at the forefront of the expected world demographic decline?
How do people respond in terms of demographic behaviors (i.e.
mortality, fertility and migration) to the changes in human development and the environment in cities, and how does population urbanization in turn shape trajectories of sustainable development?
The aim is to introduce students to the quantitative data used to characterize city populations and identify human risks and societal capacities of adaptation with respect to changes in the built and natural environments.
Opportunities to explore these data are offered in the form of applied research during lab sessions and the writing of a final term paper.
Topics addressed:
Overview of the international trends in urbanisation and population growth in urban areas Evaluation of theoretical models and the societal determinants of the components of demographic change (mortality, fertility and migration) in cities Examination of the inequalities in population numbers, trends and socioeconomic composition between and within cities Discussion of the interactions between population urbanisation, human development and environmental change Introduction to data sources used to define urban areas and measure changes in population numbers and composition
En articulant des savoirs théoriques et architecturaux, avec des savoirs socio-politiques, l'UE vise à vérifier la possibilité d'un imaginaire contemporain réaffirmé autour de l'habitat productif.
Le modèle urbain de la "ville productive" remet en question le zonage moderne - la séparation stricte des fonctions - au profit de nouvelles mixités.
Il invite à réintégrer l'espace de production au plus proche de l'habitat pour diminuer les flux pendulaires, soutenir une économie de proximité, et renforcer les liens entre producteurs, consommateurs et territoires.
Centré sur des formes visibles et localisées d'activités économiques (telles que les ateliers, makerspaces ou les petites industries) le modèle de la "ville productive" tend cependant à ignorer une part croissante du travail réellement exercé dans les centres urbains :
celui, plus diffus et statistiquement invisible, réalisé au domicile.
L'essor des home-based businesses est pourtant significatif :
les entreprises à domicile sont « la forme dominante d'entreprise en termes de nombre, et le segment avec la croissance la plus rapide dans la plupart des économies occidentales ».
Ces formes de travail sont caractérisées par leur flexibilité, leur dispersion spatiale et leur inscription croissante dans l'environnement numérique.
Qu'elles soient pérennes ou temporaires, ces formes de travail à domicile indépendant cachent des réalités diverses.
D'un côté, la désynchronisation des temps sociaux, la porosité croissante des espaces de vie, et l'isolement des travailleurs fragilisent les conditions de travail et complexifient les équilibres entre vie professionnelle et personnelle.
De l'autre, ces pratiques dessinent les contours d'une économie de voisinage, et participent silencieusement à une redéfinition plus large des dynamiques productives à l'échelle urbaine.
Enfin, ces bouleversements s'inscrivent dans le cadre du logement à la fois en temps qu'espace architectural historiquement pensé pour la vie domestique de la famille nucléaire, à la fois comme lieu où s'articulent de nombreux temps sociaux, rapports de pouvoir et inégalités sociales.
Dans ce contexte, quel regard critique porter sur le modèle de la « ville productive » ?
Quelle est la pertinence, d'un point de vue architectural et social, d'espaces de production au plus près du logement ?
En s'inscrivant simultanément dans les champs de l'architecture, de la sociologie et de l'ethnographie, l'unité d'enseignement favorise une approche interdisciplinaire, permettant une étude critique de la coexistence des fonctions domestiques et productives dans l'espace urbain.
L'UE-C invite les étudiant·es à s'approprier des outils d'enquête, d'analyse et d'observation proposés par la sociologie.
Un travail d'enquête au sein d'habitats productifs permet de dépasser les oppositions trop binaires entre logement et travail, individuel et commun.
En formulant une pensée de l'habitat productif, il s'agit d'explorer comment de nouvelles articulations entre logement collectif, espaces de production et communs dessinent les contours spatiaux et sociaux d'une économie de voisinage.
Le cours se focalisera sur trois filières susceptibles de s'intégrer au logement pour mieux transformer la ville depuis l'intérieur :
artisanat, maintenance, et care.
En effet, ces économies du faire et du soin constituent un « travail vivant et situé » contribuant à la mise en forme d'un monde habitable, relationnel, durable.
Elles permettent de penser les manières d'habiter la ville productive, à partir d'un ancrage local et relationnel.
Tout le long du semestre, de nombreux apports théoriques viendront enrichir les discussions à la table.
Ces cours seront aussi des occasions d'échanges collectifs et de débats sur le thème de la ville productive.
L'unité d'enseignement prendra la forme d'un atelier opérationnel dans lequel l'esprit visionnaire et abstrait proposé par la littérature utopiste cherchera une forme urbaine concrète en composant avec des fragments récoltés dans le vaste répertoire figuratif offert par l'histoire de l'architecture.
Le cours Visions et Utopies est conçu comme une randonnée aventureuse entre visions idéales et figurations utopiques de l'imaginaire architectural.
Un imaginaire merveilleux et surprenant qui a produit un nombre démesuré de visions apparemment invraisemblables.
Derrière l'aspect étrange de ces images se cache l'extraordinaire fécondité de la pensée architecturale et des formes tangibles qu'elle procure aux idées et aux pulsions du progrès scientifique.
Ces images ne sont pas uniquement des représentations de la ville et de ses constructions, mais aussi des outils opérationnels qui assument une valeur cruciale pour la réflexion théorique et la pratique du projet architectural.
En ce sens, ce sont bien des formes visuelles de communication mais aussi des dispositifs critiques mis au service de la culture disciplinaire contemporaine.
Afin de comprendre la nature et les horizons de ces images qui font le pont entre théorie et pratique, différents exemples seront analysés :
des villes idéales de la Renaissance à la Città Analoga, des utopies littéraires à Collage City, des scénographies théâtrales à Roma Interrotta, de Campo Marzio à la City of Composite Presence...
La relation entre morphologie urbaine et type architectural sera approchée de manière explicite à la fois grâce aux outils de l'art rhétorique, tels que l'analogie et l'allégorie, ainsi que grâce aux techniques de la composition architecturale, tels que le collage et l'assemblage.
CONTENT The course Visions et Utopies is conceived as an adventurous journey through ideal visions and utopian representations of architectural imagery.
Such marvelous and surprising imagery has produced a vast amount of seemingly improbable visions.
These images, despite their peculiar appearance, conceal the extraordinary richness of architectural thinking and give tangible form to abstract ideas and impulses of scientific progress.
These images serve as representations of the city and its architecture, but they also function as operational tools that hold crucial value for design and related theoretical thinking.
In this sense, they are visual forms of transmission as well as commentary and criticism of contemporary disciplinary culture.
To comprehend the nature and scope of these images that bridge theory and practice, various examples from the history of the discipline will be studied:
from the ideal cities of the Renaissance to the Città Analoga, from literary utopias to Collage City, from theatrical scenographies to Roma Interrotta, from Campo Marzio to the City of Composite Presence...
In particular, the relationship between urban morphology and architectural type will be explored in an operative way through the tools of rhetorical art, such as allegory and analogy, as and the techniques of architectural composition, such as collage and assemblage.
Ce cours explore une définition spécifique de la rationalité architecturale, en empruntant au surréalisme et à l'épistémologie de Bachelard pour tenter de comprendre la manière dont les formes architecturales fonctionnent lorsqu'elles nous émerveillent.
À travers l'examen minutieux et la catégorisation d'un échantillon d'architectures à travers l'histoire et les continents, "L'Architecture Merveilleuse" vise à proposer une définition nouvelle et spécifique de la rationalité architecturale.
Elle élargit l'idiome surréaliste d'une série de poètes pour offrir une théorie concise de l'architecture en tant que tentative rationnelle de produire des merveilles.
Un ensemble de thèmes décrivant ce que peut être une architecture merveilleuse sera discuté dans le cours, suivis par la présentation de différents régimes de merveilleux :
contextuel, territorial, typologique, structurel, matériel, réglementaire, historique, analogique, etc.
A partir de l'analyse d'une série d'édifices éloquents, le cours explore l'idée que la rationalité de l'architecture repose sur un récit théorique écrit spécifiquement pour chaque projet, qui produit à la fois de l'intelligibilité et du mystère, et que la poétique qui caractérise l'architecture résulte précisément de cette tension interne."L'Architecture Merveilleuse" est un cours théorique d'un praticien et d'un enseignant ;
en d'autres termes, il s'agit d'un effort réflexif pour déchiffrer, interroger et discuter l'éthique de la création architecturale.
Faisant suite à Architecture of the Real (Le Moniteur, 2003) et à The Poetics of Reason (Poligrafia, 2020), ce cours poursuit l'investigations des mécanismes d'une rationalité et d'une poétique proprement architecturales.
Cette nouvelle epxloration part et s'éloigne des rationalismes historiques les plus courants :
le symbolique de Boullée et Ledoux, le structurel de Viollet-Le-Duc, le scientifique de May et Meyer et le typologique de Rossi, afin d'interroger le type même de rationalité nichée dans cet héritage occidental de l'architecture rationnelle.
En bref, une fois compris que l'imagination, l'analogie et le symbolisme ont effectivement fourni l'architecture la plus rationnelle, le détour par le surréalisme fournit un modèle pour rationaliser les aspects non mesurables de l'architecture, un ensemble d'outils possibles pour surmonter une division stérile entre les régimes des nombres et de la poétique.Plus précisément, le merveilleux tel qu'il est explicité par les poètes surréalistes français comme André Breton (Manifeste surréaliste, 1924), Michel Leiris (Essai sur le Merveilleux, 1927) et Louis Aragon (Le Paysan de Paris, 1927) devient ici le plan détaillé d'une typification possible de l'architecture :
surprise, contradiction, banalité, raisonnement et proportion.
En tissant la lecture critique du rationalisme historique en architecture avec le modus operandi revivifié des poètes surréalistes, cet essai donne une compréhension renouvelée de la rationalité dans la fabrication de l'architecture :
une série d'opérations formelles prises rationnellement et n'apparaissant comme telles qu'avec les critères d'un cadre imaginaire soigneusement élaboré.
Construction Policy seeks to familiarise architecture and engineering students with instruments of policy analysis, evaluation and, eventually, design.
This by introducing elements of policy theory, examining historical and contemporary case studies, and preparing a proposal.
Today's architectural programs reflect a widespread desire amongst students to question and possibly change many of the established rules of territorial development, from the resources in use to the building types to focus on, the ways to construct these buildings to the industrial supply chains behind them.
In an ideal world, we would privilege the use of natural materials and ban that of C02 emitters, limit new construction activity and redistribute existing built space, recycle construction components and limit the circulation of newly produced ones, control energy consumption modalities and define preferred patterns of living for the whole community.
But how easy is it to move from theory to practice within a sector that, economically, defines our lives and the welfare of many amongst us?
What is required to reach social agreement and concrete action in the presence of multiple political constituencies with differing stakes, and thus different ideological positions, in relation to the construction industry and its numerous extensions?
The clarification of these very issues is at the centre of the subject, which focuses on technical change and what can bring it about.
To this end, it analyses how government strategies and political decisions (and in some cases lack thereof) may affect or adapt to the construction characteristics of the built environment as well as the industrial processes underlying its production.
The discursive framework of the class is defined as a critique of the Davos Baukultur Quality System, an instrument created by the Swiss Federal Office of Culture (FOC) in 2021.
By introducing parameters seldom considered as part of the debate, Construction Policy's aim is to show how much more complex than rhetorics reality is.
Through close readings of key examples, the course revisits the historical evolution of architectural drawing and representation as autonomous entities, aiming to reclaim the agency of architectural drawing as a project.
The tools of assemblage, methodologically developed and theorised during the Dada movement, have long been central to the production of architecture, both drawn and built.
From analogue and digital tools of drawing and painting to modelling techniques, and even curatorial projects, the seminars address key projects that use architectural media (drawings, paintings, collages, films, and models) beyond the pure representational purposes but instead as a systematic form of enquiry.
The course discusses the use of media in architecture- and in particular drawing- not so much as a tool for surveying, recording, and representing, but as a project in its own right.
It undertakes a close reading of artistic and experimental methods and practices, as well as precedents that have historically shaped the foundation of architectural representation and projection.
It reads architectural drawing as an assembled form;
a mode of thinking and design, that inherently reflects the intellectual, technological, cultural, and political ethos of the time.
It aims to bring together various experimental and scientific methods, analytical devices and artistic practices to explore the use of media and representation of space as a form of multi-scalar investigation;
one that expands from the scale of the architecture to the territory and the urban as well as collective and individual imaginaries.
Course Sessions:
Sessions 1-2:
Drawing as a Project 17 Sep.
2025, 12pm.-16pm.
The session reviews the early experiments with perspectival compositions in Renaissance paintings.
The seminar discusses how the perspective structures allowed the painters to assemble multiple spatial and temporal fragments in order to construct complex narratives.
Sessions 3-4:
On Abstraction and Organisation 1 Oct.
2025, 12pm.-16pm.
The seminar reviews drawing as tool for codification, categorisation, and projection.
From Machiavelli's military diagrams codifying the composition of the army to avant-garde architectural experimentations such as Archizoom's no-stop city, these types of simplification of spatial elements aims to produce systems that are quantifiable and reproducible.
Sessions 5-6:
On Collage and Photomontage 15 Oct.
2025, 12pm.-16pm.
The sessions review early 20th-century experimentations with collage and photomontage, from Surrealist photography to advertisement, and cinema.
We will discuss the emergence of Paper Architecture through early photo montages by Mies van der Rohe, to Ron Herron's Pop-Art collages, and ultimately the composite drawings of the second generation of Russian avant-gardes.
Sessions 7-8:
On Salvador Dalí's Paranoid-Critical Method 5 Nov.
2025, 12pm.-16pm.
The sessions review Dalí's artistic Paranoid-Critical method, introduced in his 1935 manifesto Conquest of the Irrational.
We will closely read Koolhass' seminal book Delirious New York both as a response to and further development of the method applied in metropolitan architecture.
We further investigate such innovative narrative techniques applied in poetry, cinema and painting.
These techniques are revisited not only as representational and descriptive devices but also as research and design tool.
Sessions 9-10:
On the Transposed Landscapes of Zoe Zenghelis 19 Nov.
2025, 12pm.-16pm.
Inspired by metropolitan structures, landforms and abstract tectonics, Zoe Zenghelis' paintings create an unprecedented imaginary;
a form of critique that represents reality as an assemblage of selected spatial, political, social and psychological relations.
The sessions undertake a close reading Zoe Zenghelis' artistic practice in order to chart the untold history of her collaboration with OMA, as well as her teaching career at the Architectural Association that brought in massive change, not only in the way architectural representation was thought at the school, but also in how it reintroduced painting as a mode of thinking about space, light, colour, and proportion;
a fundamental shift in architectural pedagogy.
Sessions 11-12:
On Architectural Model and Spatial Imaginaries 3 Dec.
2025, 12pm.-16pm.
The sessions revisit the history of architectural model making and models as tools for "construction of an imaginary".
They review critical, artistic, and spatial prac­tices that engage with architectural model not merely as a representational tool, or scaled replica of a reality, but rather as theatres of imaginaries and counter-imaginaries.
From Dutch traditional Doll's houses to Do Ho Suh's 1:1 see-through models, these spaces reject any programmes or clients' expectations;
they are autonomous projective devices that foster, enable, or direct collective imaginations.

Au travers d'une approche centrée sur la typologie, les enseignants exploreront de grands types de logements rationalistes pour en comprendre les origines historiques, mais aussi les aspirations et les implications sociales et politiques.
Délivré par deux architectes praticiens, dont l'un engagé dans des recherches à caractère historique et l'autre sur l'habitat, ce cours se caractérise par une approche multidisciplinaire qui lui permet d'aborder un grand nombre des dimensions qui définissent la complexité du logement.
L'originalité de la démarche réside aussi dans une approche essentiellement typologique, soulignant l'importance de la forme dans toute question architecturale, dans celle du logement en particulier.
Ainsi, l'articulation usage/organisation formelle, appropriation spatiale/proportions et mesures, ainsi que le potentiel d'une série de grands types du logement rationnel seront déconstruits et explicités.
L'immeuble à cour, la barre, le plot et la nappe seront ainsi successivement investigués.
Ils le seront en eux-mêmes, pour comprendre leurs rouages, raison d'être et performances intimes, mais aussi pour expliciter, dans une perspective historique, les relations que ces types entretiennent, comment leurs modes d'apparition successifs et respectifs obéissent à des objectifs historiques, liés à l'usage, à l'évolution sociale et à des modèles politiques singuliers.
Cet enseignement transmet les notions de base dans les méthodes d'étude et d'analyse en archéologie de la construction.
L'objectif est de développer chez les étudiant.e.s une meilleure compréhension du bâti ancien qui leur permettra d'avoir une approche plus sensible de l'objet architectural.
Cet enseignement aborde l'étude des rapports enrte la conception constructive et structurale des édifices et le langage de l'architecture antique et médiévale au travers de plusieurs exemples.
La démarche de l'archéologie de la construction repose sur la vie du bâtiment, les différentes phases de construction qu'il a connues, mais aussi sur les techniques mises en oeuvre et les outils utilisés par les ouvriers qui l'ont édifié.
C'est une discipline à cheval sur l'architecture, l'histoire (de l'architecture) et l'archéologie.
Pratiquée depuis le XVIIe siècle, l'archéologie du bâti devient une discipline à part entière à la fin du XXe siècle, début du XXIe en Italie.
On parle "d'Archeologia del costruito".
Et c'est de l'intérêt romantique pour les ruines, qu'un scientifique français, Arcisse de Caumont, réalise au milieu du XIXe les premières investigations archéologiques raisonnées sur des édifices médiévaux en élévation.
Il considérait sans a priori aucun, les constructions du Moyen Âge comme source de l'histoire.
L'émergence de la discipline a été favorisée par les restaurations d'édifices anciens et le développement de l'archéologie urbaine.
Dans le dernier tiers du XXe, l'intérêt des scientifiques pour les questions techniques est révélateur d'une nouvelle attitude.
L'édifice devient un lieu d'étude pluridisciplinaire et de valorisation culturelle.
Nous aborderons aux travers de plusieurs exemple ce que peut être le travail d'un architecte et/ou archéologue sur un chantier, le développement des méthodes d'études et de relevés depuis le XIXe siècle jusqu'à aujourd'hui ainsi que les enjeux majeurs de ce type d'étude.
Urban green offers a variety of services and thus plays an important role in the transformation of our cities.
The course provides an overview of various innovative approaches to the planning and design of multifunctional green spaces, focussing on how to build green and blue infrastructures.
The future transformation of our cities faces a multitude of challenges that make it important to pursue multidimensional approaches:
The aim is to design urban green and open spaces in such a way that they build green and blue infrastructure while fulfilling ecological benefits and, beyond that, various design and social requirements.
As urban areas are hotspots of climate change, they must be designed to contribute to the adaptation of cities to climate change, better retain water during heavy rainfall, and provide habitats for urban biodiversity.
Cities are also living spaces for people, which means that quality of life and fair access to open spaces must be maintained and people's physical and mental health and well-being promoted.
Since space is a scarce resource in urban agglomerations, different requirements often collide in the same space, frequently leading to conflicts of use, for example in connection with densification, for which suitable and cost-efficient solutions must be developed.
In the international context, a whole series of new approaches have developed in recent years that consider the planning and design of green spaces from such multiple perspectives and, above all, in relation to adaptation to climate change in order to establish comprehensive green and blue infrastructures.
Based on the principle of multifunctionality, the course introduces the scientific basis for the fundamental concepts of ecosystem services, nature-based solutions and green or blue-green infrastructure in urban areas.
Building on this, it then uses a broad range of concrete international case studies to illustrate innovative approaches to the planning of green spaces and the development of green infrastructures:
Green spaces and green-blue infrastructures, the ecosystem services they provide and the basic principle of multifunctionality to be implemented Social and governance aspects and environmental justice From large to small scale - green space and green infrastructure planning at different scales, interrelationship between formal and informal planning processes.
Cities in climate change and nature-based solutions to support adaptation to climate change Therapeutic mechanisms and health effects of green spaces, design of green spaces and green space systems to support human health and social wellbeing Analysis and critical discussion of numerous innovative international planning and design concepts for green spaces and green infrastructures (e.g.
green belts, double inner development in the redensification of settlements, picoparks, urban gardening + agriculture, urban forestry + urban rewilding, animal-aided design) Role of participatory approaches
This Superstudio will study the history of the villa by focusing on 30 case studies, from antiquity to the last century.
The aim of this study is to understand through the architecture of the villa the most quintessential tropes of architecture:
form, politics and representation.
Negative Utopia An Illustrated History of the Villa Superstudio, Fall 2025 TPOD Team:
Pier Vittorio Aureli, Romain Barth, Michela Bonomo, Theodora Giovanazzi, Marson Korbi, Constantinos Marcou The villa is perhaps one of the most enduring types in architecture:
it first emerged two millennia ago, and it still exists.
Since its invention, it has represented the same aspirations:
escape from the city, return to nature, and the 'good life'.
In principle, these are everyone's aspirations, but the villa was meant to make them exclusive.
As such, the villa works as a 'negative utopia' whose exclusionary logic is defined by class relationships.
The villa has always embodied, in the most archetypical terms, class and status, and as such is one of the most potent forms of hegemonic architecture produced by the ruling classes of all times.
In his seminal study of this type, James Ackerman has argued that the villa is an ideological form whose main goal is to sustain, in highly symbolic and allegorical terms, narratives about domination and control.
It is interesting to note that the development of architecture as a discipline is profoundly intertwined with the history of the villa.
With the rediscovery of this type in the Renaissance, the design of villas was the prerogative of the early 'professional' architects who distinguished themselves from master masons.
These architects exploited the idiosyncratic forms of villas as a way to experiment with architecture and promote their role as authors of unique buildings.
This authorial idea of the villa has survived to this day since the villa still represents for architects the opportunity to affirm in uncompromising terms their idea of architecture.
Yet, villas were never the product of architects' imagination alone;
their form was also the appropriation of existing rural customs and even folk traditions.
Inventions such as the 'vernacular' and the 'picturesque' were the elite's appropriations and idealizations of peasant culture that was celebrated while it was subtly exploited.
For this reason, to frame the villa only as a matter of privilege is--perhaps--too simplistic.
Because of their intense ideological nature, villas were imaginative constructs, invented worlds, poetic versions of life in which the power of architecture to represent reaches its utmost intensity.
It is precisely their formal and symbolic surplus that makes them--for better or worse--a compelling form of architecture.
If, within the history of domesticity, changes and reforms have always been introduced by the ruling classes, villas were laboratories of innovation in which both architects and clients ostensibly challenged given norms and canons.
And yet, precisely the villas that were meant to challenge the status quo became canonical architectures imitated by dwellers of all classes.
The history of villas is thus much more complex and nuanced than what their pastoral aura may lead one to perceive.
Villas were sophisticated representations of the world, in which every architectural element refers to a larger idea than itself.
Within the architecture of villas, loggias, pediments, and even seemingly utilitarian elements such as a pigeon-tower are symbolic devices.
This surplus of architectural representation was not an excess per se;
it served the most important mandate of the villa:
the domination of the territory.
The villa emerged in ancient times when class struggle opposed peasants and the elite;
in order to gentrify the rural territory of Rome, the elite appropriated the rustic way of life of the peasants, elevating the latter to the dignity of the good life.
This operation implied the appropriation of the farm and its transformation into a luxury retreat.
As such, the villa became an ambivalent architecture, both private and public, since it was both a retreat and a monumental head of the land it dominated.
A similar operation was repeated in the Renaissance when a new elite, scared by pandemics and by class struggle in cities, transformed rural castles into palaces in which the relationship between domestic space and its surrounding landscape took unprecedented importance.
It is for this reason that the villa is arguably the first architectural type to open up the interior towards the exterior.
As such, the exterior, which is the life that surrounds the villa, is domesticated and controlled.
The villa is thus a paradoxical type:
as much as it aims to celebrate its 'splendid isolation,' its architecture is deeply intertwined with its context, and without it, the villa cannot exist.
This paradox is very much present in the most important modern offspring of the villa:
the suburban single-family house.
Behind its ostensible goal to democratize the villa as mass-produced domestic space, the single-family house has contributed to make private property the nomos of liberal democratic societies.
More recently, the villa has remained a major financial asset and a status symbol, but at times it has also become the opportunity for interesting architectural experiments in which to propose new forms of dwelling.
In some case villas are architects' manifestos or autobiographical portraits of themselves or their clients.
This year, 'Superstudio' will study the history of the villa by focusing on thirty case studies that span from antiquity to the last century.
The aim of this study is not to design villas, but to understand through the architecture of the villa the most quintessential tropes of architecture:
form, composition, and representation.
Above all, the goal of Superstudio is to use the villa as an exemplary artifact with which to test the ability of reading a singular architectural object as a synecdoche of an entire historical period.
For this reason, a central topic of the studio is the idea of exemplarity in architecture:
the possibility of interpreting a building in order to define a larger domain.
No matter how unique and unprecedented an architecture can appear, once carefully and rigorously interpreted specific buildings can become examples that shed light on entire historical periods.
The capacity of studying architectures as 'examples' is thus a central theme in architectural research.
Rather than starting from sweeping generalizations and then looking for evidence, working with examples implies the opposite.
Focusing on examples means starting with a specific case study and searching for the way its singularity can shed light onto the whole, not in spite of but because of its singularity.
For this reason, this Superstudio is not on the villa per se, but on the possibility of studying architecture as a meaningful object, as something that in itself becomes the vantage point through which to understand the world.
Analogy as Method As mentioned above, the goal of this Superstudio is not to design but to study the villa.
The final product of the studio will be a drawing known as 'Analogous Map.' This drawing can be understood as a 'drawn essay' in which the research content is not written but represented by means of visual elements.
These elements work as analogies of the research content.
For this reason, in terms of methodology, the main focus of the Superstudio is the notion of 'analogy.' Analogy is the comparison of something to something else for the purpose of explanation.
Analogy cannot fully rely on a rational explanation, but, rather, works through imagination and by mobilising one's knowledge and memories.
In some respects, analogy is an incomplete explanation or illustration of something, and it is precisely such incompleteness that triggers the imagination.
However, within analogy, imagination does not run wild but is subtly directed and informed so that it might be an intersubjective tool--one which works as long as those who use or interpret such analogies share common references or a common ethos.
It is important to emphasize that analogies are not metaphors.
Metaphors imply a morphological resemblance between what exists and its representation;
analogies, on the contrary, rely on knowledge rather than resemblance.
For example, Palladio's use of the dome in his Villa Capra is not a metaphor, but an archetype that establishes an analogy between the villa and the temple in order to reinforce the house as a sacred domain.
This analogy was possible because in the Western world a dome signified sacred buildings, and as such it was never placed on top of a profane building such as a house.
Because of their ideological role, villas are full of analogical forms:
orientation, openings, terraces, roofs are architectural features that evoke something other than the villa itself.
In this way, a villa can be interpreted as a complex text in which the micro and the macro are in constant relationship.
The goal of the Superstudio is to reveal these analogies by mapping them into an inventive and historically accurate drawings.
Besides decoding analogies, the drawing will represent the physical, social and economic context by using figures taken from the iconographic landscape of the period in which each villa was build.
The ambition of this exercise is to bridge imagination and history, invention and erudition.
Against the idea that imagination is effective when set free, the brief argues that imagination can only work through rigorous knowledge.
The Analogous Map In order to facilitate the undertaking of this exercise, the Superstudio team has selected thirty case studies of villas from antiquity to the last century.
Each group of students will work on one case study.
Case studies will be assigned ex officio via a lottery.
The selection criteria are based on architectural relevance and available literature.
Although they do not exhaust the rich history of this type, the thirty examples selected offer a concise historical overview of villas.
For each case study we have selected a minimal bibliography that eventually students can (and should) expand.
After gathering and reading the bibliography, each group will write a short and concise text that close-reads the villa and situates it within its historical context.
This text will be the 'script' on which to compose the analogous map.
Each map--a drawing that measures 80x80cm - will be first drafted as a collage of images and drawings.
The starting point will be a plan and axonometric representation of the assigned villa, around which the map will unfold as a sort of 'mandala.' Within this scheme, every architectural and historical fact will be drawn as figures taken from a rich iconographic repertoire.
A reference for this kind of composition is the analogous map par excellence:
Aldo Rossi's 'Analogous City', a visual essay on the city that Rossi and his collaborators composed for the 1976 Venice Biennale.
In this famous image, Rossi composed both historical examples and his own architectures in order to stage as one composite vision his own idea of the city.
In the same manner, each group of students will visualize their case study as a composition of figures and architectures whose goal is to offer a visual description and explanation of the assigned villa.
Once the analogous map is drafted, it will be retraced as a line drawing.
This passage is key.
By translating the composition into a uniform medium, the analogous map is no longer a collage but one drawing in which multiple scales and images will coalesce as one narrative.
By retracing the material collaged in the draft, things can be changed, modified, and even deformed.
The surgical precision of line drawing is the adequate technique for this kind of drawing because it will emphasize the detail as the key protagonist of the composition.
It should be stressed that, in order to work, the analogous map should be a very detailed drawing in which the whole is never subsuming the importance of the detail.
In spite of its unitary form, the analogous map is also a labyrinth, and as such it becomes the analogy of history itself, in which nuances and contradictions resist any sweeping statement.
Finally, the analogous map will be supported by an explanatory legend that will caption every element used.

L'énoncé théorique de master constitue la première partie du Projet de Master.
L'étudiant·e pose les bases théoriques de son travail, décrit le cadre thématique, référentiel et méthodologique.
Il·elle énonce clairement et précisément la question centrale d'architecture, objet de son projet.
REMARQUE:
UNIQUEMENT AU SEMESTRE MASTER 3 L'énoncé théorique de master s'apparente dans son esprit à la « thèse » universitaire, bien qu'il soit de dimension et de durée d'élaboration très réduite (un semestre).
L'étudiant·e énonce la thématique qu'il·elle souhaite développer et dresse un état des lieux (thématique, documentaire, géographique, programmatique, méthodologique).
Le questionnement est au centre de ses préoccupations, à travers l'élaboration de l'énoncé l'étudiant·e clarifie sa position, le thème central qu'il·elle développera à travers son projet, l'approche théorique qui le sous-tend.
Il·elle précise la problématique, ses axes de recherche prioritaires, ainsi que les options méthodologiques qui lui seront propres tout au long de sa démarche.
L'énoncé définit également les périmètres d'étude et d'intervention, les différentes échelles de travail, et débouche sur les prémices du projet, jusqu'à une possible esquisse de faisabilité.
La recherche documentaire, l'analyse et l'exploitation des sources bibliographiques, cartographiques et iconographiques, l'élaboration d'un programme qualitatif et quantitatif font partie de ce que l'énoncé théorique requiert.
La mise en forme du document lui-même, la qualité rédactionnelle, la présentation et le rapport équilibré, lisible et sensé entre texte et iconographie sont également pris en compte pour l'évaluation de l'énoncé théorique.
English The theoretical statement of the Master's degree is similar in spirit to the university "thesis" although it is very small in size and duration (one semester).
Students state the theme that they wish to develop and draw up an inventory (thematic, documentary, geographical, programmatic, methodological).
The questioning is at the center of their concerns.
Through the elaboration of the statement students clarify their position, the central theme that they will develop through their project and the theoretical aaproach that underlies it.
They specify the issue, their priority research axes, as well as the methodological options that will be used throughout the project.
The statement also defines the perimeters of the study and intervention, the different scales of work, and leads to the beginnings of the project, up to possible feasibility sketch.
Documentary research, analysis and exploitation of bibliographic, cartographical and iconographic sources, elaboration of qualitative and quantitative program are part of what the theoretical statement requires.
The formatting of the document itself, the quality of the writing, the presentation and the balanced, readable and sensible relationship between text and iconography are also taken into account in the evaluation of the theoretical statement.
Le Projet de Master, d'une durée d'un semestre, est un projet d'architecture mené par l'étudiant·e de manière autonome.
Il·elle choisit lui·elle-même les membres du groupe de suivi, la thématique et le site de son étude.
Une des caractéristiques principales du Projet de Master en architecture à l'EPFL est le libre choix du thème du travail par l'étudiant·e, qui devient acteur·rice principal·e de ses choix, de la constitution de l'équipe de suivi au choix de la problématique et de la méthodologie associées au projet, jusqu'aux options de présentation et représentation de son travail, en cercle restreint lors des critiques intermédiaires ou en public lors de l'examen.
L'étudiant·e élabore un projet d'architecture en lien avec les prémices de l'Enoncé théorique de master rédigé durant le semestre précédent, et répondant aux questionnements qu'il·elle aura soulevés par son étude.
Engagé·e dans un processus de travail autonome, accompagné·e par le groupe de suivi, l'étudiant·e doit faire la preuve de sa capacité à lier théorie et projet, hypothèses et réalisation, contraintes de tout type et décisions concernant les différentes échelles du projet (implantation, réalisation), méthodologie, objectifs et résultats.
Une approche du projet en tant que recherche, inscrit dans un contexte référentiel élargi, mais dans une optique de réponse spatiale à de réelles questions de société.
L'interdisciplinarité est encouragée à travers la collaboration possible d'enseignant·es issu·es de tous les domaines de l'EPFL au sein du groupe de suivi.
English One of the main characteristics of the Master Project in Architecture EPFL is the free choice of the theme of work by the students, who become the main actors of their choices, from the the constitution of the monitoring team to the choice of issues and methodology associated with the project, up to the options of presentation and representation of their work, whether in a restricted circle during intermediary critiques or in public during the final examination.
Students develop an architectural project in line with the premises of the Master's Theoretical Statement written during the previous semester, and responding to the questions raised by their study.
Engaged in a process of autonomous work, accompanied by the monitoring team, students must demonstrate their ability to link theory and project, hypotheses and implementation, constraints of all types and decisions concerning the different scales of the project (implementation, realization), the methodology, objectives and results.
An approach as a research project, set in a wider referential context, yet with a view to providing a spatial response to real social issues.
Interdisciplinarity is encouraged through the possible collaboration of teachers from all fields of EPFL withing the monitoring team.

L'Unité introduira le dessin comme l'outil clé de la communication entre ingénieurs et architectes et comme médiateur entre la construction et l'étudiant.
Grâce au dessin, nous analyserons des projets structurels sélectionnés qui incarnent une interaction exemplaire entre l'espace et la structure.
Drawing constitutes a very powerful and critical tool of conceptual design.
Drawing constructs thought, it acts as a communication interface between the work and the mind and between different disciplines;
it is the most powerful language of communication in the working together between architects and engineers.
The UE Docta Manus Structures will introduce the basic drawing techniques (sketch, plan, section, elevation, axonometry, perspective).
Based on these techniques, we will further investigate analytical drawing methods capable of exploring structural concepts and their architectural solutions.
Through hand drawing we will analyse selected projects that embody an exemplary interplay of architecture and engineering, as e.g.
the work of Mies van der Rohe, Jean Prouvé, Luigi Nervi, Robert Maillard or Eugène Freyssinet.
Our main focus lies on the load bearing structure and its tectonic and spatial articulation as common intersection between architecture and engineering.
Through analysis, students will enter into dialogue with construction in a direct way.
They will get a sense for the adequacy of tools and refinements of solutions.
We will investigate proportion, material innovation and tectonic articulation in relation to the structural idea and become aware of the importance of detail.
Analysis will take apart and make transparent the parameters and dependencies of the design process and will open the work into a condition of possibility.
We will draw by hand, as this is the most direct and immediate way of becoming aware of technique in relation to intention (it forces to take decisions).
Drawing by hand is a cognitive process where the dynamic relation between doing and thinking is essential.
That is why `the more you draw, the more you see' and vice versa.
The construction of points and lines on a sheet of paper will sensitize students to the notions of scale, size, proportion, transparency and composition.
The learning hand will build up tacit knowledge.

This course equips students with the tools for action and influence within institutional systems, drawing on the fields of sociology, political science, and social psychology.
It explores how to better convince decision-makers, shift behaviors, and design more effective and impactful public policies Introduction :
Presentation and discussion of key concepts and approaches of urban governance (ex.
governance, decision, innovation, institution, decision making, technology etc.) Political systems analysis and policy making :
presentation and discussion of approaches and theories from political science and sociology useful to develop a deeper understanding of how policies are designed and influenced by political systems and institutions.
Decision making :
presentation and discussion approaches and evidence from decision sciences explaining how individuals, groups and governing bodies make (good or bad) decisions and why.
The science of influencing behaviors :
presentation and discussion around the questions "what is a rational decision?" and "are we rational in our decisions?" with contribution from behavioral, psychology, social psychology and sociology.
Ultimately, the question will be :
"how can we influence a decision?" Solution designs and impact strategies:
by capitalizing on the previous sections, strategies and solution susceptible to enhance the chance of positive impact will be presented, discussed and designed.
Each approach and theme will be illustrated with cases studies.
This course explores the connections between spatial justice, social equity, and the socio-ecological transition.
Through theoretical insights and empirical case studies, it provides tools to critically assess urban transformations and imagine fairer and more hospitable cities.
The course is structured around 14 sessions that combine theoretical insight and empirical investigation.
It introduces students to key justice theories (Rawls, Sen, Fraser, Young) and applies them to the analysis of urban processes such as housing, mobility, infrastructure development, and ecological transition.
Particular attention is paid to how technical systems, material infrastructures, and spatial arrangements participate in shaping unequal urban conditions and influence the possibilities for just and inclusive transitions.
Through thematic modules, the course covers topics such as green gentrification, energy precarity, mobility justice, responsible densification, participatory planning, and the management of urban commons.
It explores the social implications of infrastructural and architectural decisions in contexts marked by climate urgency and resource constraints.
Urban case studies from both the Global North and South provide a comparative framework to evaluate the role of planning, governance, and technical expertise in shaping urban futures.
Students are invited to question how material configurations such as transportation networks, energy infrastructures, building standards, and public space arrangements can produce or mitigate social inequalities and environmental injustices.
Students will gain tools to critically engage with the spatial, technical, and political dimensions of their practice, and to design solutions that are both ecologically responsible and socially inclusive.

Cities are complex systems shaped by natural, technological, and social factors with historical roots.
Through global case studies, this course will explore how science and technology transform cities into objects of knowledge and intervention.
Cities can be seen as complex systems simultaneously shaped by natural, technological, and social factors, often with deep historical roots.
Reciprocally, cities largely configure how human and nonhuman activities take place in the past, present, and future.
To better understand this double movement, this course investigates how science and technology contribute to transforming cities into objects of knowledge and intervention.
Based on both past and present case studies and on a global approach (comparing cities from different regions of the world), we will study how architects, engineers, natural and social scientists, with their corresponding tools and theories, grapple with a living milieu that, by 2050, is expected to house 70% of the world population.
Throughout the semester we will address three main topics:
Cities as built environments, or how the city is physically constructed through buildings, infrastructures, and urban planning;
Cities as sustainable environments, or how the city interfaces with the natural milieu, sustaining (or not) life through health and hygiene, biodiversity and climatic resilience;
Cities as social environments, or how the city enables certain forms of social life, but also restrain others, through social stratification, mobility, and public spaces.

Introduction In this course we give a hands-on introduction on the use of modeling and data in chemistry.
After an introduction in the different tools used by computational chemists, we discuss three topics in more detail.
We start with the course with an example of molecular simulation, which we use to predict the adsorption isotherms of materials that are used for carbon capture.
Next, we are addressing the question on how to store chemical data electronically.
The main idea here is how to create an open science infrastructure for chemistry.
With an open science infrastructure, we will have access to large amounts of data, which can be processed using Machine Learning, which will be our last topic.
Content The course has an introduction and three separate modules:
Computational Carpentry:
In this part, we introduce the computational environment.
We show you how to install the required packages on your computer and you will learn some very basic Python and Bash Molecular Simulation of Adsorption:
In this module we show how one can predict an adsorption isotherm from the crystal structure of a material.
Data in Chemistry:
In this module we discuss data in chemistry.
Open science is becoming the norm for scientific research.
This implies that we have to think about how to make data publicly available.
In this module, we show how to store chemical data and how to make data available in electronic format using standard protocols and formats through the systematic use of electronic laboratory notebooks.
Machine Learning in Chemistry:
In this module we discuss the use of Machine Learning (ML) in Chemistry.
ML is a technique to discover correlations in very large data sets.
We show how ML can be used to analyze the data from the adsorption simulation.

This course provides an overview of the geothermal energy sector, spanning core topics of geology, thermodynamics, hydrogeology, and geochemistry and tackles questions of geothermal resource exploration, assessment, exploitation, economics, and environmental, and societal considerations.
The objective of this course is to provide students with an overview of the geothermal energy sector, from fundamental basics to resource exploration, assessment, exploitation, and economic/environmental/societal consequences.
The course is divided into three main parts:
In the first part, we review key concepts in geology, thermodynamics, hydrogeology, and geochemistry, contextualised to geothermal systems.
In the second part of the course, we address resource exploration, assessment, and exploitation.
Students will apply the general knowledge gained in the first part of the course to understand how we search for and identify geothermal resources.
Students will learn how heat and energy availability are assessed.
The course will also offer an overview of exploitation techniques.
In the third part of the course, we will focus on specific methods and challenges particular to a selection of geothermal type systems, including enhanced geothermal systems.

L'Unité introduira le dessin comme l'outil clé de la communication entre ingénieurs et architectes et comme médiateur entre la construction et l'étudiant.
Grâce au dessin, nous analyserons des projets structurels sélectionnés qui incarnent une interaction exemplaire entre l'espace et la structure.
Drawing constitutes a very powerful and critical tool of conceptual design.
Drawing constructs thought, it acts as a communication interface between the work and the mind and between different disciplines;
it is the most powerful language of communication in the working together between architects and engineers.
The UE Docta Manus Structures will introduce the basic drawing techniques (sketch, plan, section, elevation, axonometry, perspective).
Based on these techniques, we will further investigate analytical drawing methods capable of exploring structural concepts and their architectural solutions.
Through hand drawing we will analyse selected projects that embody an exemplary interplay of architecture and engineering, as e.g.
the work of Mies van der Rohe, Jean Prouvé, Luigi Nervi, Robert Maillard or Eugène Freyssinet.
Our main focus lies on the load bearing structure and its tectonic and spatial articulation as common intersection between architecture and engineering.
Through analysis, students will enter into dialogue with construction in a direct way.
They will get a sense for the adequacy of tools and refinements of solutions.
We will investigate proportion, material innovation and tectonic articulation in relation to the structural idea and become aware of the importance of detail.
Analysis will take apart and make transparent the parameters and dependencies of the design process and will open the work into a condition of possibility.
We will draw by hand, as this is the most direct and immediate way of becoming aware of technique in relation to intention (it forces to take decisions).
Drawing by hand is a cognitive process where the dynamic relation between doing and thinking is essential.
That is why `the more you draw, the more you see' and vice versa.
The construction of points and lines on a sheet of paper will sensitize students to the notions of scale, size, proportion, transparency and composition.
The learning hand will build up tacit knowledge.

This course advances geomechanics knowledge, focusing on lab tests, in situ & geophysical investigations for interpreting geotechnical projects.
Practical modules cover rock physics, mechanics, borehole & subsurface geophysics.
Long Summary The evaluation of the geomechanical parameters of rock masses in large projects is a topic of great importance given the geological complexity of these masses and the difficulties in their evaluation.
These difficulties are related to the uncertainties associated with the rock mass, whose characterization is normally carried out through in situ and laboratory tests.
In this course, the students will learn practical skills to analyse rock masses affected by geological structures, such as discontinuities, folds, fracture and faults at both lab and site scales and understand how rocks deform in geo-engineering projects.
In a first part, we show the fundamental techniques for laboratory measurements of rock physical (i.e., density, permeability, elastic properties, electrical and thermal properties) and mechanical (i.e., USC, triaxial strength, shear strength, frictional properties, fracture toughness) properties.
In a second part, we introduce the most common (borehole and large scale) geophysical methods for site investigation and survey.
The methods represent a primary tool for investigation of the subsurface and are applicable to a wide range of problems (e.g., prospecting for natural resources, geological surveying, and engineering investigations).
This course involves student groups conducting laboratory experiments that significantly enhance student understanding of rock mechanics and physics.
Content The objective of this course is to advance student knowledge in geo-mechanics, and discuss the utility of laboratory tests and in situ and geophysical investigation in the interpretation of large scale geotechnical projects.

The cell-free synthetic biology course introduces engineers to the most commonly used techniques required to conduct work in Biotechnology and Bioengineering.
Additionally, this course is an experiment in democratizing education and open science by generating useful resources for the local community Note:
this course is limited to a maximum of 16 students The hands-on Cell-free synthetic biology laboratory course will introduce engineering students to fundamental methods and techniques commonly used in Biotechnology and Bioengineering.
In this course the students will generate a cell-free transcription and translation system called the PURE system, which entails learning and performing polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), protein overexpression, protein purification, and other important molecular biology techniques.
The students will then assess the functionality of their PURE systems by quantifying the expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Cell-free systems are becoming exceedingly powerful and therefore popular tools in biotechnology, bioengineering, and synthetic biology.
In one recent example the 2019 EPFL iGEM team who won the iGEM competition that year, developed a cell-free molecular diagnostic kit for the identification and differentiation of two grapevine diseases (see first link below).
In addition, we have shown in the past that cell-free systems are ideal tools for education and teaching by providing local high-schools with cell-free educational kits (see second link below).
The cell-free synthetic biology course is therefore exploring the possibility to leverage the ample resources available in higher education to generate an additional, synergistic benefit for the population.
We are hoping that with this course we will be able to sustainably produce cell-free educational kits for use in local schools.
The cell-free synthetic biology course will consist of a couple of introductory lectures, followed by laboratory experiments.
The students will be guided through all the required steps required for each specific method and technique to generate functional cell-free systems (see third link below for a video guided tutorial published by our laboratory describing the steps required to generate a cell-free system).
At the end of course, if we succeeded to produce functional cell-free systems we plan to package them into kits together with the students of the class and distribute them to interested local high-schools for their use in their biology curriculum.

Space environment is different from what we can experience on Earth, requiring specific design approaches in order to achieve reliable operations.
Engineers must hence face new challenges stimulating their creativity to tackle those particular constraints.
The course will start with a general overview of the space environment, including vacuum, radiations, thermal, micro-gravity and vibrations constraints.
All these elements have a large impact on the design of space mechanisms as well as space hardware during their entire life span.
The next topic that will be addressed will be the selection of materials, taking into account their properties as well as their compliance to the space environment.
The design of space mechanisms being a vast subject, the present course will then tackle specific topics related to structure, components (including motors and actuators), bearings, sensors, and their reliability.
The methods used for managing space projects will also be addressed in the frame of the course.
The course will be based on practical examples and will also introduce the students to the management of space mechanism projects.
Exercises will support the understanding of the concepts.
The main objective of the course is not to encompass the design of mechanisms in all its details, but to get an overall view of what are the constraints and challenges related to the design, manufacturing and operations of space equipment, and potentially to unleash the creativity of the students.
It is aimed at the future space mechanism designers but also at engineers who will have to deal with space mechanisms or are simply curious, in order for them to understand the strengths and limitations of such mechanisms.
The objective of the course is to present with different viewpoints, the lessons learned which lead to the decisions in the space exploration and their consequences today and for the decades to come.

At the end of the course, students are able to develop their own sustainability assessment using the Sustainability Solution Space methodology.
Sustainability assessments can support informed decision-making, enabling humans to make an optimal contribution to sustainable development.
Although sustainability assessments are widely used, several issues persist:
What constitutes a "good" method for evaluating the sustainability of urban systems?
How can we decide upon what is sustainable, specifically in the context of urban systems?
What role do normative and systemic aspects play in assessing sustainability?
This course is designed to provide students with methodological and theoretical content on sustainability issues, enabling them to conduct well-conceived sustainability assessments for cities worldwide.
At the end of the course, students will be able to develop their own sustainability assessment using the Sustainability Solution Space methodology.
Some of the key questions of the course are listed below.
What is a sustainability assessment?
What are the key sustainability issues in urban areas?
What are the systemic, normative, and procedural aspects of sustainability assessments?
How can we develop policy options using a sustainability assessment
The book "Solid Waste Engineering - A Global Perspective" is the basis for this course.
This textbook is an excellent introduction to the field of Solid Waste Engineering and gives insight into relevant solid waste treatment technologies and practices.
Transversal skills will be fostered as well.
With the third edition of Solid Waste Engineering, the authors have decided to expand this college textbook to focus on the worldwide problem of solid waste management.
This change is illustrated by the addition of "A Global Perspective" to the title.
Given that we are currently using our natural resources at an unsustainable rate, polluting our oceans and land with a variety of waste products and altering our atmosphere with gases that are causing further global warming, now is the time to educate future engineers with knowledge and tools to address these worldwide problems.
The 3rd Edition was also adapted in view of the needs of the students who are taking the Solid Waste Engineering course at EPFL.
The course is following the logic structure and the chapters of the book.
The third edition has been rearranged to follow the hierarchy of solid waste management:
reduce, reuse, recycle and recovery.
Thus, students will first learn about integrated waste management strategies, an expertise which will support the future engineer to take measures for pollution prevention as well as for resources conservation.
In chapter 2 the students are introduced to municipal solid waste characteristics, including the identification of different waste components and materials.
Component specific information is needed for recovery, separation and recycling of waste materials.
The relevance of chemical, physical and mechanical properties are discussed in more detail as a basis for the chapters which follow.
These properties are most helpful in order to identify potentially meaningful recycling pathways, as well as to decide about possible technological separation and purification options.
The next chapter is dedicated to the collection of municipal solid waste, a key, but many times overlooked, component of integrated waste management.
Following collection is mechanical processing, in most cases the necessary first step to the recycling and recovery of municipal solid waste.
The students will then study mechanical, biological, and thermal processes.
For each of these topics the authors have dedicated a separate chapter which will introduce the students to the basic principles of these separate disciplines in the context of waste management.
Since not all waste streams can be recovered, students move on to residue management by combustion and landfilling.
Finally, students are exposed to the current issues in solid waste management and the principles of integrated and sustainable solid waste management.
It is recommended to buy the book in advance of the course as e-book or as printed edition.
The book (hard cover edition) can also be borrowed from the teacher for a deposit of CHF 100.
In a few cases the activities at EPFL and the home reading will be complemented with field visits to waste treatment facilities.
In addition a group work will focus on specific waste related aspects.
These learnings will be transcribed into a video so that these group specific learnings can be made available to the other students in this and in future courses.

This course introduces the theory and application of modern convex optimization from an engineering perspective.
Convex optimization is a fundamental branch of applied mathematics that has applications in almost all areas of engineering, the basic sciences and economics.
For example, it is not possible to fully understand support vector machines in statistical learning, nodal pricing in electricity markets, the fundamental welfare theorems in economics, or Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games without understanding the duality theory of convex optimization.
The course primarily focuses on techniques for formulating decision problems as convex optimization models that can be solved with existing software tools.
The exact formulation of an optimization model often determines whether the model can be solved within seconds or only within days, and whether it can be solved for ten variables or up to 10^6 variables.
The course does not address optimization algorithms but covers the theory that is necessary to follow advanced courses on algorithm design such as EE-556:

Ce cours présente une introduction aux méthodes d'approximation utilisées pour la simulation numérique en mécanique des fluides.
Les concepts fondamentaux sont présentés dans le cadre de la méthode des différences finies puis étendus à celles des éléments finis et spectraux.
Le cours s'ouvre sur une présentation des éléments théoriques de base concernant les équations aux dérivés partielles (adimensionalisation, linéarisation, classification mathématique).
Après une présentation unifiée des méthodes d'approximation classiques, la méthode des différences finies est utilisée de manière à illustrer les concepts fondamentaux liés à la discrétisation des équations aux dérivées partielles.
Puis, à partir de problèmes simplifiés, mono-dimensionnels, stationnaires et instationnaires, les équations sont progressivement enrichies pour aboutir au traitement de problèmes multi-dimensionnels, à plusieurs variables, et finalement à celui des équations de Navier--Stokes avec la méthode des éléments finis et spectaux.
Les méthodes de résolution de systèmes d'équations algébriques (linéaires et non-linéaires) sont présentées en mettant l'accent sur leurs conditions d'applicabilité et leur complexité algorithmique.
Les laboratoires basés sur des exercices en Matlab permettent d'illustrer l'ensemble des concepts théoriques, ainsi que de comprendre l'implémentation et l'utilisation des algorithmes présentés.

A partir de la forme forte du problème-modèle unidimensionnel de la déformation axiale d'une barre à section uniforme en traction-compression, une formulation intégrale, puis faible, est développée dans un premier temps.

Les notions de fonctions de base, de classes de fonctions, d'espaces fonctionnels de Hilbert et de Sobolev et de convergence, nécessaires pour la compréhension de l'approche, sont brièvement décrites et la distinction entre conditions aux limites naturelle et essentielle est discutée.
Une généralisation du problème-modèle unidimensionnel par l'introduction de diverses discontinuités (chargement, section, matériau, ...) dans la barre est ensuite étudiée et la notion d'éléments finis d'ordre élevé est abordée.
Selon une démarche analogue à celle utilisée pour le problème unidimensionnel, le cours s'intéresse dans un second temps au problème-modèle bidimensionnel du transfert-chaleur par conduction jusqu'à sa formulation faible discrétisée en éléments finis bidimensionnels à variable scalaire (température).
Les concepts d'éléments finis pères lagrangiens et sérendipiens, quadrangulaires et triangulaires, sont introduits, puis utilisés pour la création d'éléments finis bidimensionnels à géométrie quelconque (éléments finis géométriquement déformés).
Après une étude de convergence des solutions approchées par éléments finis bidimensionnels, le cours se clôt sur un exemple d'application complet.
L'objectif de ce cours est d'apprendre à réaliser de manière rigoureuse et critique des analyses par éléments finis de problèmes concrets en mécanique des solides à l'aide d'un logiciel CAE moderne.
Le but de ce cours est de transmettre aux étudiants les bases techniques et méthodologiques utiles à la réalisation d'études par éléments finis de problèmes concrets de mécanique des solides et des structures.

This course introduces the theory and application of modern convex optimization from an engineering perspective.
Convex optimization is a fundamental branch of applied mathematics that has applications in almost all areas of engineering, the basic sciences and economics.
For example, it is not possible to fully understand support vector machines in statistical learning, nodal pricing in electricity markets, the fundamental welfare theorems in economics, or Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games without understanding the duality theory of convex optimization.
The course primarily focuses on techniques for formulating decision problems as convex optimization models that can be solved with existing software tools.
The exact formulation of an optimization model often determines whether the model can be solved within seconds or only within days, and whether it can be solved for ten variables or up to 10^6 variables.
The course does not address optimization algorithms but covers the theory that is necessary to follow advanced courses on algorithm design such as EE-556:

Streaming:
given a large dataset as a stream, how can we approximate its basic properties using a very small memory footprint?
Examples that we will cover include statistical problems such as estimating the number of distinct elements in a stream of data items, finding heavy hitters, frequency moments, as well as graphs problems such as approximating shortest path distances, maximum matchings etc.;
Sketching:
what can we learn about the input from a few carefully designed measurements (i.e.
a `sketch') of the input, or just a few samples of the input?
We will cover several results in sparse recovery and property testing that answer this question for a range of fundamental problems;
Sublinear runtime:

We will cover sublinear time algorithms for graph processing problems, nearest neighbor search and sparse recovery (including Sparse FFT);

Probabilistic proof systems (eg PCPs and IPs) have had a tremendous impact on theoretical computer science, as well as on real-world secure systems.
They underlie delegation of computation protocols and hardness of approximation.
This course covers the foundations of probabilistic proof systems.
Proofs are at the foundations of mathematics, and verifying the correctness of a mathematical proof is a fundamental computational task.
(The P versus NP problem, which deals precisely with the complexity of proof verification, is one of the most important open problems in all of mathematics.) The complexity-theoretic study of proof verification has led to new notions of mathematical proofs, such as Interactive Proofs, Probabilistically Checkable Proofs, and others.
Probabilistic proofs are a powerful tool for proving hardness of approximation results, and are an essential building block to achieve delegation of computation (protocols that enable super fast verification of long computations, such as SNARKs).
Via these applications, probabilistic proofs have had a tremendous impact on theoretical computer science and, more recently, are playing an exciting role in applied cryptography, computer security, and blockchain technology (e.g., they help secure billions of dollars in transactionds per day).
This course provides an introduction to probabilistic proofs and the beautiful mathematics underlying them.Covered topics include arithmetization, the sumcheck protocol, zero knowledge, doubly-efficient interactive proofs, linearity testing, low-degree testing, proof composition, succinct verification, and more.

This course covers the principles, architectures, and applications of foundation models and generative AI, including generative methods, tokenization, multi-modal learning, adaptation, prompting, and their use in reasoning, decision-making, and scientific domains.
This course introduces the principles, methods, and applications of foundation models and generative AI, i.e., two areas that increasingly shape the frontiers of machine learning.
Foundation models are large-scale models pretrained on broad and diverse data, capable of adapting to a wide range of downstream tasks across modalities.
While not all foundation models are generative, many leverage generative modeling techniques, such as autoregressive prediction, variational inference, diffusion processes, and flow-based transformations, to learn expressive representations and enable open-ended generation.
The course begins with the core generative model families, covering their objectives, mathematical foundations, and applications in language, vision, and scientific domains.
It then transitions to the design and scaling of foundation models, focusing on tokenization across modalities, architectural choices, and training strategies.
Students will explore multi-modal learning, prompting, adaptation (e.g.
fine-tuning, test-time training), and the role of reinforcement learning in aligning model behavior with desired outcomes.
Throughout, the course highlights how foundation models and generative AI increasingly intersect, particularly in the development of world models, where learned generative representations support simulation, planning, and decision-making.
Through lectures, assignments, and hands-on exercises, students will gain both theoretical and practical understanding of the foundations, capabilities, and frontiers of generative and foundation models, and their growing impact across scientific and engineering domains.

This course focuses on goal-directed design and interaction design, two subjects treated in depth in the Cooper book (see reference below).
To practice these two methods, we propose a design challenge, which is further divided into mini-projects evenly spaced throughout the semester.
Design methods for HCI What is HCI:
its aims and goals Design thinking Goal-directed Design Mental model and different types of users Qualitative research and user interviews User modeling:
persona and empathy diagram Scenarios, requirements and framework design Visual design Information Visualization design Basic prototyping methods for HCI Storyboarding Context scenario Interactive prototype Video prototype Human computer interaction evaluation methods Cognitive walkthrough Heuristic evaluation Evaluation with users
This course consists of two parts:
1) architecture of automation systems, hands-on lab 2) dependable systems and handling of faults and failures in real-time systems, including fault-tolerant computing Trends like digitalization and internet of things affect the way industrial plants are designed, deployed and operated.
Industrial Automation comprises the control, communication and software architecture in (real-time) automation systems:
factories, energy production and distribution, vehicles and other embedded systems.
As we move towards an AI economy, the success of new products, systems and services depend increasingly on the excellence of personal experience.
This course introduces students to the notion and practice of experience design following a hands-on, studio-based approach.
Experience design in practice encompasses the collection, analysis and design of users experiences based on a deep understanding of the context concerned.
We will examine these processes using a series of mini-workshops, to rapidly iterate on multiple design experience options.
The goal is to create a meaningful, interactive, data-driven (and possibly AI-assisted) digital interface and physical prototypes for new experiences.
We explore questions at the intersection of physical and digital architecture through an experience design approach, involving:
(1) a mapping of the social dynamics surrounding an experience;
(2) a critical analysis of the geographical and temporal flows (experience journeys);
and (3) a detailed evaluation of the experience touch points.
Based on this experience diagnosis, we propose alternative designs of experience blueprints that combine physical and digital touch points which in turn will constitute the elements of future typologies.
Our particular focus will be on information intensive typologies in the contemporary city, such as museums, libraries, airports, banks, boutiques, governments, universities, hospitals and homes.
Each year, we will investigate a different typology.
Digital interfaces and augmented artifacts will be considered as possible alternatives to reconfigure the senses of perception, redistribute time, and reorchestrate the configuration of social, emotional and spatial experiences.
The seminar will combine students from both IC and ENAC to work together in a real interdisciplinary process.

This course covers both classic concepts and recent advances in computer vision and machine learning for processing visual data -- with a primary focus on embodied intelligence and multimodal learning Visual perception is the capability of inferring the properties of the external world merely from the light reflected off the objects therein.
This is done beautifully well by simple (e.g., mosquitoes) or complex (e.g., humans) biological organisms.
They can see and understand the complex environment around them and act accordingly -- all done in an efficient and astonishingly robust way.
Computer vision is the discipline of replicating this capability for machines.
Despite a remarkable progress in the past few years, a large gap to sophisticated perceptual capabilities, such as those exhibited by animals, remains.
The goal of this course is to discuss what is possible in computer vision today and what is not.
We will overview the basic concepts in computer vision and recent advances in machine learning relevant to processing visual data, multimodal learning, and active perception.
For inspiration around the missing capabilities and how to approach them, we will turn to visual perception in biological organisms.
The course includes lectures, homeworks, and projects.
There will be a heavy emphasis on the projects and hands-on experience.
The homework tasks will focus on key tools and concepts in ML, including Transformers, LLMs, multimodal foundation models, and perceptual simulation environments The course project will be around designing, implementing, and testing a solution to a (preferably open) problem pertinent to visual perception.
The students are encouraged to work in groups, propose a project that interests them, and pursue ambitious yet feasible goals.
The course staff will provide support throughout the semester with the projects.
In the lectures, the students will learn about the principles of computer vision and multimodal learning, the current limits, and the visual perception in humans and animals, which will help them with formulating their course projects.
In particular, the lectures will discuss the following:
An overview of basic computer vision concepts:
classification, detection, grouping, image transformations, optical flow, 3D from X, etc., and recent neural network architectures, such as Transformers.
Psychology/physiology of the visual system.
Multimodal leanring and multimodal foundation models.
Perception-action loop:
active perception and embodied vision.
The course interests masters/PhD students interested in research in computer vision, machine learning, and perceptual robotics, as well as senior undergraduate students interested in understanding state-of-the-art computer vision.
This advanced graduate course teaches the key design principles underlying successful computer and communication systems, and shows how to solve real problems with ideas, techniques, and algorithms from operating systems, networks, databases, programming languages, and computer architecture.
A modern computer system spans many layers:
applications, libraries, operating systems, networks, and hardware devices.
Building a good system entails making the right trade-offs (e.g., between performance, durability, and correctness) and understanding emergent behaviors.
Great system designers make these trade-offs in a principled fashion, whereas average ones make them by trial-and-error.
In this course, we develop a principled framework for computer system design, covering the following topics:
Modules and interfaces Names Layers Indirection and virtualization Redundancy and fault tolerance Client/server architectures Distributed systems Transactional building blocks

Probabilistic proof systems (eg PCPs and IPs) have had a tremendous impact on theoretical computer science, as well as on real-world secure systems.
They underlie delegation of computation protocols and hardness of approximation.
This course covers the foundations of probabilistic proof systems.
Proofs are at the foundations of mathematics, and verifying the correctness of a mathematical proof is a fundamental computational task.
(The P versus NP problem, which deals precisely with the complexity of proof verification, is one of the most important open problems in all of mathematics.) The complexity-theoretic study of proof verification has led to new notions of mathematical proofs, such as Interactive Proofs, Probabilistically Checkable Proofs, and others.
Probabilistic proofs are a powerful tool for proving hardness of approximation results, and are an essential building block to achieve delegation of computation (protocols that enable super fast verification of long computations, such as SNARKs).
Via these applications, probabilistic proofs have had a tremendous impact on theoretical computer science and, more recently, are playing an exciting role in applied cryptography, computer security, and blockchain technology (e.g., they help secure billions of dollars in transactionds per day).
This course provides an introduction to probabilistic proofs and the beautiful mathematics underlying them.Covered topics include arithmetization, the sumcheck protocol, zero knowledge, doubly-efficient interactive proofs, linearity testing, low-degree testing, proof composition, succinct verification, and more.

This course will serve as a first introduction to the geometry of Riemannian manifolds, which form an indispensible tool in the modern fields of differential geometry, analysis and theoretical physics.
Differentiable manifolds appearing in fields ranging from PDEs to theoretical physics usually come equipped with a Riemannian metric;
this is simply a symmetric tensor defining an inner product on the space of tangent vectors over each point of the manifold.
In contrast to a simple differentiable manifold which only carries topological information, a Riemannian manifold also contains a geometric structure:
A Riemannian metric allows us to define notions such as the length of a curve or the distance between two points in the manifold.
In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts associated to Riemannian geometry, such as the Riemannian metric, the curvature tensor and the notion of a geodesic curve.
We will then proceed to explore the geometric properties of these objects, in many cases extending ideas and results from Euclidean geometry to this more general setting.
We will also discuss the consequences of certain geometric assumptions on the topology of Riemannian manifolds.
The course will cover the following topics:
Riemannian metrics Riemannian connections and geodesics The curvature tensors The metric structure of a Riemannian manifold and the Hopf-Rinow theorem The geometry of hypersurfaces Comparison theorems and topological applications

This is an introductory course on Gaussian fields and processes - or more shortly, on Gaussian magic.
By discussing both the general theory and concrete examples, we will try to understand where and how Gaussian processes appear, and how to study them.
This course serves as an introduction to the world of Gaussian processes.
Gaussian processes are omnipresent in modelling random phenomena.
There are at least two reasons for it:
1) Gaussian processes appear naturally through the Central Limit Theorem and its relatives;
2) Gaussian models have many special properties that make their mathematical study interesting...and possible.
The aim of this course is to better understand these two reasons by both looking into general properties of Gaussian measures, and by studying in detail some concrete Gaussian models.
Here is a tentative list of topics:
- Different characterisations of standard Gaussians (via stable laws, entropy etc) and revisiting the Central Limit Theorem;- Basic properties of finite-dimensional Gaussian measures (including marginal laws, conditional laws);- Existence and constructions of infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes, Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and their basic properties;- Suprema and continuity of Gaussian processes;- Some of the models potentially discussed:
Gaussian random matrices, the Random Energy Model, the Discrete Gaussian free field;
Gaussian process regression;
Brownian motion/bridge.
With high motivation, the course can be followed already at BA6 level too.

The first part is devoted to Monge and Kantorovitch problems, discussing the existence and the properties of the optimal plan.
The second part introduces the Wasserstein distance on measures and develops applications of optimal transport to PDEs, functional/geometric inequalities, traffic models.
The theory of optimal transport began in the eighteenth century with the Monge problem (1781), which is to minimize the cost of transporting an amount of material from the given set of origins to the given set of destinations.
In the fourties, Kantorovitch gave an important reformulation of the problem and, since then, the Monge-Kantorovitch problem has been a classical subject in probability theory, economics and optimization.
More recently, the interplay between optimal transport and various fields such as PDEs (Ricci flow, Euler equations¿), fluid mechanics, geometric analysis (isoperimetric and Sobolev inequalities, curvature-dimension conditions), functional analysis, urban planning and economics has been deeply investigated.
The first part of the course will be devoted to Monge and Kantorovitch's problems, discussing the existence and the properties of the optimal plan under different conditions on the cost.
We will exploit the relation with Kantorovitch's duality theorem, with Brenier's polar decomposition theorem, and with the Monge-Ampere equation, a PDE which arises naturally in this context.
The second part of the course will be centered on the applications of optimal transport to different problems:

This is an introductory course in ergodic theory, providing a comprehensive overlook over the main aspects and applications of this field.
Ergodic theory is the study of group actions on measure spaces.
Its history traces from Poincare's recurrence theorem in celestial mechanics and Boltzman's ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics to its mathematical proliferation in the 1930s through the ergodic theorems of von Neumann, Birkhoff, and Koopman.
It has since grown into a hugely important research area with striking applications to other areas of mathematics.

This course will serve as a basic introduction to the mathematical theory of general relativity.
We will cover topics including the formalism of Lorentzian geometry, the formulation of the initial value problem for the Einstein equations and applications on the global structure of the spacetime.
General relativity is a theory of gravity in which space time are jointly modeled by a 4 dimensional differentiable manifold equipped with a Lorentzian (i.e.
pseudo-Riemannian) metric tensor.
The geometry of the spacetime is determined by the matter present at each point via the celebrated Einstein field equations.
Therefore, understanding the predictions of general relativity for the structure of our universe requires both a geometric and an analytic approach.
In this course, we will introduce the basic notions of Lorentzian geometry (extending concepts introduced in any course of Riemannian geometry) and study the causal and geometric structure of Lorentzian manifolds appearing as solutions of the Einstein equations.
We will also study the initial value problem formulation for the Einstein equations, which will be viewed as a system of evolution equations.
Finally, we will explore the consequences of these equations on the global structure of the spacetime in the presence of black holes or in the case of cosmological solutions.

Basic Lorentzian geometry Causal structure of Lorentzian manifolds The linear wave equation The initial value problem for non-linear wave equations The Einstein field equations Formulation of the initial value problem for the Einstein equations Existence and uniqueness of spacetime solutions The maximal globally hyperbolic development Examples:

Nondimensionalized Navier-Stokes equations result in a great variety of models (Stokes, Lubrication, Euler, Potential) depending on the Reynolds number.
The concept of boundary layer enables us then to identify the different components of the hydrodynamic drag.
Wave drag is finally introduced.
The objective of this class is to describe and understand hydrodynamic flows by means of physical modeling.
With help of dimensional analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations, several fluid models are introduced depending on the dominant physical effects:
hydrostatics, capillarity, dissipation or inertia.
This approach allows to describe important concepts like lift or wave dispersion and naturally leads to the concept of boundary layer so as to understand the appearance of drag.
Wave drag is also introduced and its origin discussed.
This course focuses on the physical mechanisms at the origin of the transition of a flow from laminar to turbulent using the hydrodynamic instability theory.
Learn to understand the complex phenomena originating in the destabilization of laminar flows, and their transition to turbulence.
Know how to linearize the fluid equations and to formulate the question of stability of a flow in terms of an eigenvalue problem and a dispersion relation.
Identify the physical mechanisms resulting in classical instabilities as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
Spatial instability in open flows.
Understanding the different types of bifurcations.
Reading scientific literature.
This course provides an introduction to the physical phenomenon of turbulence, its probabilistic description and modeling approaches including RANS and LES.
Students are equipped with the basic knowledge to tackle complex flow problems in science and engineering practice.
Turbulence is a ubiquitous physical phenomenon observed when fluids - liquids or gases - flow at high speeds.
The fluctuating chaotic non-equilibrium phenomenon modifies the lift and drag of airfoils and affects the efficiency of mixing and combustion.
It also is the driving force creating our weather and influences timescales on which stars and galaxies form in the universe.
This course provides an introduction to the physical phenomenon of turbulence, its probabilistic description and modeling approaches.
Thereby students will be equipped with the fundamental understanding of turbulence that allows to tackle specific flow problems in science and engineering practice.
Specific topics covered include:
Based on the Navier-Stokes equations together with symmetry assumptions, a probabilistic description of turbulence will be developed.
The results of classical Kolmogorov theory for turbulence in an incompressible Newtonian flow will be interpreted in terms of a phenomenological description of physical processes in turbulence.
Specific concepts include energy cascades and the quantitative estimation of relevant length- and timescales of the turbulent dynamics.
The need for modeling turbulent flows will be motivated and common turbulence models as well as associated simulation strategies will be discussed.
Finally, current research topics including intermittency corrections of the classical Kolmogorov results, transition to fully developed turbulence and turbulence decay will be covered.
This course provides practical experience in the numerical simulation of fluid flows.
Numerical methods are presented in the framework of the finite volume method.
A simple solver is developed with Matlab, and a commercial software is used for more complex problems.
Numerical flow simulation (or Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD) is an essential component of modern fluid mechanics research and engineering, complementary to theory and experiments.
This course builds on the student's existing knowledge in fluid mechanics and numerical methods to introduce numerical flow simulation.
Some numerical methods are presented for the discretization and resolution of the steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations and simpler advection-diffusion equations, in the framework of the finite volume method.
A basic in-house code is developed with Matlab for simple problems.
The overall modeling and simulation workflow is presented:
pre-processing (mesh creation), computation (choice of physical models and numerical methods, flow calculation), validation, and post-processing (visualization and analysis).
A state-of-the-art commercial software (Fluent) is used to study practical applications.
This course introduces the theory and application of modern convex optimization from an engineering perspective.
Convex optimization is a fundamental branch of applied mathematics that has applications in almost all areas of engineering, the basic sciences and economics.
For example, it is not possible to fully understand support vector machines in statistical learning, nodal pricing in electricity markets, the fundamental welfare theorems in economics, or Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games without understanding the duality theory of convex optimization.
The course primarily focuses on techniques for formulating decision problems as convex optimization models that can be solved with existing software tools.
The exact formulation of an optimization model often determines whether the model can be solved within seconds or only within days, and whether it can be solved for ten variables or up to 10^6 variables.
The course does not address optimization algorithms but covers the theory that is necessary to follow advanced courses on algorithm design such as EE-556:

Convex optimization is a fundamental branch of applied mathematics that has applications in almost all areas of engineering, the basic sciences and economics.
For example, it is not possible to fully understand support vector machines in statistical learning, nodal pricing in electricity markets, the fundamental welfare theorems in economics, or Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games without understanding the duality theory of convex optimization.
The course primarily focuses on techniques for formulating decision problems as convex optimization models that can be solved with existing software tools.
The exact formulation of an optimization model often determines whether the model can be solved within seconds or only within days, and whether it can be solved for ten variables or up to 10^6 variables.
The course does not address optimization algorithms but covers the theory that is necessary to follow advanced courses on algorithm design such as EE-556:

In an ever more complex world, adoption is a critical factor for innovation.
Using creativity and a transdisciplinary approach, this course brings together user-centred design and a deep understanding of value to develop sustainable innovations that benefit both citizens and the economy.
Note:
the first three weeks are instrumental to the rest of the semester as they provide specific tools and the core theoretical background for performing the group project.
Climate change, digital health, trust in AI:
all these essential challenges require more than just science, technology and business.
Involving humans in the process is key to these solutions being adopted by society.
Recent failures of the metaverse or NFTs underline how adoption is core to innovation.
To achieve it, we must understand practical needs and constraints, but also cultural perspectives, human emotions and underlying motivations.
Design, and more generally culture, have shown to be key elements linking technology and society throughout history, from the Renaissance up to the decentralisation of computing resources in the 1970s.
In this course, we delve into human needs and perception and explore how creative methodologies can be embedded into the innovation process.
The course aims to provide:
A practical design research framework for innovation management, with emphasis on the creative process, user experience psychology and innovation.
Tools and skills to address real problems with real people, through an applied project performed in small groups.
An understanding of how to ensure a project's viability by defining how value is created, delivered and captured.
Throughout the semester, you'll experiment with creative approaches to generate disruptive yet sustainable propositions by focusing on user perception.
Economic dimensions, looking at created value, delivered value and captured value will also be integrated in the creative and human centric process, to provide a holistic overview of innovation with sustainable impact.
You will learn these concepts by working on an applied project in small groups over the whole semester.
Project themes will be related to a current research topic from EPFL+ECAL Lab, allowing interaction with researchers, practitioners and stakeholders.
You will conduct field research, create prototypes, and perform user tests with real citizens.
The intent of this project is to encourage interchange between students and their mentors.
Each student, in consultation with her or his mentor, will choose a company that the student will analyze in context of its primary industry.
The company may be that of the mentor, but is not required to be.
This project has two major parts.
The first part is an applied company and industry analysis of a firm as agreed upon by the student and her/his mentor.
The format of the report is a detailed SWOTT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats, and (optionally) Trends) of the focal firm and its competitors in the context of the firm's identified industry.
The identified industry need not correspond to the firm's overall classification nor its primary area of commerce;
for example, an analysis of Nestlé does not have to be in terms of the company as a whole, but may instead be at the business-unit level (i.e.
chocolate, coffee products, nutritional products, etc.).
The student is wholly responsible for the research content of the report;
while the mentor may choose to contribute information, it is neither mandatory nor expected.
The student is, however, expected to interview two credible sources of information on the focal firm and its industry.
This could be a competitor, an industry supplier, or a regulator.
The second part will be a series of skills-building seminars taking place throughout the semester.
Three of these are basic sessions on writing academic and business reports.
Since the final deliverables will be graded - in part - based upon the points discussed in this session, it is advisable to attend.
A foundational course on the science and practice of launching new ventures.
The purpose is to study and experience the first stages of the entrepreneurial process:

Introduction to entrepreneurship Opportunity identification and evaluation Entrepreneurial teams Pitching and presentation skills Testing and validation Business model design Marketing and business planning Financing and fundraising Social entrepreneurship
This course focuses on the economic and organizational conditions that shape technological innovation by firms.
The intent is for students to learn core concepts that can make innovation initiatives within a firm more successful, and to then apply those concepts to real business problems and cases.
Strategic management differs from other courses in management in that it focuses on the firm as the unit of analysis.
Accordingly, the course objectives are threefold:
(1) to develop an understanding of how innovations emerge and gain adoption in the marketplace;
(2) to gain insights into how firms can transform themselves into effective innovators;
and (3) to evaluate strategies and structures that enhance venture success.
The course is particularly applicable for students interested in working for, or learning about, technology-oriented companies.
The class MGT404 is a useful follow-up to the present class.
Students will learn the core concepts and techniques of network analysis with emphasis on causal inference.

This immersive experience will allow to gain awareness and understanding of the interdependence between all Value Chain functions, and between Strategical and Operational level decision-making.
Focusing on the impact of all decisions on the corporate financial results, the course will outline the need for inter-funcitonal coordination, collaboration and alignment.
This course introduces the theory and application of modern convex optimization from an engineering perspective.
Convex optimization is a fundamental branch of applied mathematics that has applications in almost all areas of engineering, the basic sciences and economics.
For example, it is not possible to fully understand support vector machines in statistical learning, nodal pricing in electricity markets, the fundamental welfare theorems in economics, or Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games without understanding the duality theory of convex optimization.
The course primarily focuses on techniques for formulating decision problems as convex optimization models that can be solved with existing software tools.
The exact formulation of an optimization model often determines whether the model can be solved within seconds or only within days, and whether it can be solved for ten variables or up to 10^6 variables.
The course does not address optimization algorithms but covers the theory that is necessary to follow advanced courses on algorithm design such as EE-556:

La logistique, fonction transversale par excellence, intègre toutes les dimensions des processus industriels à ajout de valeur, de l'approvisionnement à la distribution aux clients et au-delà en intégrant le développement durable.
Un focus particulier sera fait sur l'approche prévisionnelle.
La logistique, fonction transversale par excellence, intègre toutes les dimensions des processus industriels à ajout de valeur, de l'approvisionnement à la distribution aux clients.
Aujourd'hui, la logistique globale doit impérativement considérer l'approche durable de la chaîne d'ajout de valeur du produit ou du service, c'est-à-dire dès la conception du produit jusqu'à son recyclage ou sa destruction, en intégrant toutes les étapes de production.
Il sera présenté dans ce cours les défis et les enjeux actuels de la logistique globale, et en particulier une des préoccupations majeures de toutes entreprises :
l'anticipation des demandes des clients.
Connaître la demande potentielle des clients, en type de produits, en temps et en lieu, permet d'anticiper les processus et ainsi de maximiser le travail en flux tendus, ce qui conduit à réduire les niveaux de stocks tout en garantissant un niveau et une qualité de service aux clients.

Technology is a driver of long-term growth but it can also undermine sustainable development.
This course introduces microeconomic models of market and collective action failures, models of complex systems, as well as policy portfolios to address these issues.
Technology is a critical driver of long-term welfare.
Yet unconstrained technological development is testing the limits of planetary boundaries and is the source of severe environmental issues.
Technological solutions to such problems often exist in theory but are frequently deployed too slowly to avoid harm.
This course (1) identifies the connections between technology, welfare, and sustainability, (2) models the sources of both market and collective action failures as well as system-level breakdowns, (3) analyzes the demand for sustainable technologies and studies why firms, households, and societies sometimes reject them, and (4) identifies the optimal design of policies to address these challenges.
The course allows students to get familiarized with the basic tools and concepts of modern microeconomic analysis.
Based on graphical reasoning and analytical calculus, it constantly links to real economic issues.

This course focuses on the biophysical mechanisms of mammalian brain function.
We will describe how neurons communicate through synaptic transmission in order to process sensory information ultimately leading to motor behavior.
The brain processes information through the concerted activity of many neurons, which communicate with each other through synapses organised in highly dynamic networks.
The first goal of this course is to gain a detailed understanding of the structure and function of the fundamental building blocks of the brain, its synapses and neurons.
In considering this goal, we will also examine some basic methods including cellular electrophysiology and optical imaging.
This will enable the student to critically evaluate how neurons are studied.
The second goal is to learn how synaptic input is integrated and processed in single neurons based on the active and passive properties of axons and dendrites.
Students will assemble their knowledge of synapses and neurons into a coherent picture of neuronal network function, with specific emphasis on the interactions of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons, plasticity and neuromodulation.
The third goal, will be to place neuronal networks in the context of how they contribute to associative learning and sensory processing ultimately leading to behavioural decisions and motor output.
These topics will be examined during Week 9 of the semester in a written exam.
In the second part of the semester, students will carry out a miniproject analysing a neurophysiological dataset.
Each student must submit their miniproject report by the last Friday of the semester.
We will cover the following specific topics:
Passive neuronal membrane properties;
Excitability;
Synaptic transmission;
Glutamatergic synapses;
GABAergic synapses;
Dendritic integration;
Synaptic plasticity;
In vivo recordings;
Sensorimotor integration;
Sensory perception;
Learning
The goal is to guide students into the essential topics of Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience.
The challenge for the student in this course is to integrate the diverse knowledge acquired from those levels of analysis into a more or less coherent understanding of brain structure and function.
Pathways into the visual brain Perception and encoding Attention and selective perception Perception and consciousness Understanding statistics Stress and emotion Learning and memory Neurobiological mechanisms of memory Emotional influences on cognitive functions Psychiatric disorders Structural and functional cortical neuroanatomy Somatosensory perception and parietal cortex in human and non-human primates Multisensory perception and parietal and premotor cortex in human and non-human primates Perception and representation of visual space in the right hemisphere Selected neurological disorders and human brain imaging Bodily self-consciousness
In this course, students will investigate causal neuronal network mechanisms underlying sensory-guided decision-making in mice.
Students will analyse published data to develop integrative neuroscience research projects including the design of new experiments to test specific falsifiable predictions.
Neurons function in highly-distributed brain-wide networks which process sensory information and guide flexible goal-directed behavior across diverse timescales according to animal needs in different contexts.
New technologies provide increasingly high-resolution measurements of the activity of many individual neurons measured simultaneously across different brain regions offering unprecedented opportunities for investigating neuronal network dynamics.
High-density multichannel silicon probes for electrophysiological measurement of extracellular potentials can provide access to the action potential firing times of hundreds of neurons measured simultaneously with millisecond precision during quantified mouse behavior in sensory decision-making tasks.
Such data begin to offer the first insights into how dynamic brain-wide neuronal computations might underlie simple cognitive functions, and in this course we will explore two such data sets.
We will first discuss relevant literature, and then re-analyse the underlying data to reproduce and extend key published findings.
Guided through discussions in class, students will then develop hypotheses for causal neuronal mechanisms underlying specific aspects of the data.
Finally, students will design new experiments, models, simulations, and analyses to test specific falsifiable hypotheses.
Students will work together in small groups to write a joint ~20 page report to be handed in by the end of the semester, which will count for two-thirds of the final grade.
Each individual student will also give a ~20 minute oral presentation during the semester, which will count for one-third of the final grade.
A further key goal of this course is to stimulate independent student thinking and to enhance problem solving capabilities.
In addition, the course provides an important component of working together with other students as a team.
Learning to organize team work and to recognize strengths of team members is therefore also a critical component of the project success.

This course covers both classic concepts and recent advances in computer vision and machine learning for processing visual data -- with a primary focus on embodied intelligence and multimodal learning Visual perception is the capability of inferring the properties of the external world merely from the light reflected off the objects therein.
This is done beautifully well by simple (e.g., mosquitoes) or complex (e.g., humans) biological organisms.
They can see and understand the complex environment around them and act accordingly -- all done in an efficient and astonishingly robust way.
Computer vision is the discipline of replicating this capability for machines.
Despite a remarkable progress in the past few years, a large gap to sophisticated perceptual capabilities, such as those exhibited by animals, remains.
The goal of this course is to discuss what is possible in computer vision today and what is not.
We will overview the basic concepts in computer vision and recent advances in machine learning relevant to processing visual data, multimodal learning, and active perception.
For inspiration around the missing capabilities and how to approach them, we will turn to visual perception in biological organisms.
The course includes lectures, homeworks, and projects.
There will be a heavy emphasis on the projects and hands-on experience.
The homework tasks will focus on key tools and concepts in ML, including Transformers, LLMs, multimodal foundation models, and perceptual simulation environments The course project will be around designing, implementing, and testing a solution to a (preferably open) problem pertinent to visual perception.
The students are encouraged to work in groups, propose a project that interests them, and pursue ambitious yet feasible goals.
The course staff will provide support throughout the semester with the projects.
In the lectures, the students will learn about the principles of computer vision and multimodal learning, the current limits, and the visual perception in humans and animals, which will help them with formulating their course projects.
In particular, the lectures will discuss the following:
An overview of basic computer vision concepts:
classification, detection, grouping, image transformations, optical flow, 3D from X, etc., and recent neural network architectures, such as Transformers.
Psychology/physiology of the visual system.
Multimodal leanring and multimodal foundation models.
Perception-action loop:
active perception and embodied vision.
The course interests masters/PhD students interested in research in computer vision, machine learning, and perceptual robotics, as well as senior undergraduate students interested in understanding state-of-the-art computer vision.
This master course enables students to sharpen their proficiency in tackling ethical and legal challenges linked to Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Students acquire the competence to define AI and identify ethical and legal questions linked to its conception and increased use in society.
AI is used as shortcut-concept to identify a number of computational systems producing intelligent behavior, i.e., complex behavior conducive to reaching goals.
AI systems are increasingly used across society.
They raise conceptual issues (how to define AI?), technological-ethical issues (how should AI systems be conceived?), legal issues (how to define the responsibility of an AI system?
how to regulate AI?) and social-political issues (which justice questions does the deployment of AI raise?) The following issues will be dealt with:
- What is ethics?
- What is an AI system?
- Who is responsible for the actions of an AI system?
- What are the most pressing ethical questions in the phase of conception of AI systems?
- How should we design AI system in order to overcome ethical-legal challenges?
- Should we regulate AI?
- How should we address the consequences of the wide deployment of AI systems?

In an ever more complex world, adoption is a critical factor for innovation.
Using creativity and a transdisciplinary approach, this course brings together user-centred design and a deep understanding of value to develop sustainable innovations that benefit both citizens and the economy.
Note:
the first three weeks are instrumental to the rest of the semester as they provide specific tools and the core theoretical background for performing the group project.
Climate change, digital health, trust in AI:
all these essential challenges require more than just science, technology and business.
Involving humans in the process is key to these solutions being adopted by society.
Recent failures of the metaverse or NFTs underline how adoption is core to innovation.
To achieve it, we must understand practical needs and constraints, but also cultural perspectives, human emotions and underlying motivations.
Design, and more generally culture, have shown to be key elements linking technology and society throughout history, from the Renaissance up to the decentralisation of computing resources in the 1970s.
In this course, we delve into human needs and perception and explore how creative methodologies can be embedded into the innovation process.
The course aims to provide:
A practical design research framework for innovation management, with emphasis on the creative process, user experience psychology and innovation.
Tools and skills to address real problems with real people, through an applied project performed in small groups.
An understanding of how to ensure a project's viability by defining how value is created, delivered and captured.
Throughout the semester, you'll experiment with creative approaches to generate disruptive yet sustainable propositions by focusing on user perception.
Economic dimensions, looking at created value, delivered value and captured value will also be integrated in the creative and human centric process, to provide a holistic overview of innovation with sustainable impact.
You will learn these concepts by working on an applied project in small groups over the whole semester.
Project themes will be related to a current research topic from EPFL+ECAL Lab, allowing interaction with researchers, practitioners and stakeholders.
You will conduct field research, create prototypes, and perform user tests with real citizens.

Neutron and X-ray scattering are some of the most powerful and versatile experimental methods to study the structure and dynamics of materials on the atomic scale.
This course covers basic theory, instrumentation and scientific applications of these experimental methods.
The application of neutron and X-ray scattering spans from crystalline matter to bio-materials and engineering, including fields like magnetism and superconductivity.
Similar to the vast possibilities with X-rays at synchrotron facilities like the Swiss Light Source at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland, the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, neutron scattering is a large-scale-facility technique with neutron sources among others at PSI in Switzerland, the Institute Laue-Langevin in Grenoble and a new joint European Spallation Source under construction in Sweden.
The course provides an introduction to the dynamic experimental techniques of neutron and X-ray scattering and covers the following aspects:
1) Theory of the neutron scattering cross section2) Neutron sources and neutron instrumentation3) Neutron imaging, neutron reflectivity and neutron small angle scattering4) Neutron diffraction, crystal structures5) Inelastic neutron scattering, phonons6) Magnetic neutron scattering, magnetic structures7) Inelastic magnetic neutron scattering, magnetic dynamics8) Theory of the interaction between X-rays and matter9) X-ray sources and X-ray instrumentation10) X-ray absorption spectroscopy11) X-ray emission spectroscopy and Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS)12) Resonant Elastic X-ray Scattering (REXS)13) Inelastic X-ray Scattering14) Time resolved pump-probe X-ray spectroscopy The course contains lectures and exercise sessions.

Le cours a pour but de fournir aux étudiants les outils nécessaires pour lire et comprendre la ville et le territoire contemporain.
Le cours s'occupe de la ville et du territoire, de leur lecture et de leur interprétation.
Pour cela, il explore la Ville-territoire contemporaine et propose l'enseignement de l'analyse urbaine et territoriale, en articulant "quatre regards" différents.
Le premier regard implique une relation directe, physique, avec l'espace urbain et territorial.
C'est un regard rapproché, lié à l'expérience des lieux, il rentre dans la ville et le territoire, en observe les espaces, les personnes et les pratiques, en restituant une dimension socio-spatiale de l'analyse urbaine en utilisant des outils descriptifs tels que le relevé, l'écoute, l'analyse techniquement pertinente.
Certaines techniques comme la photographie et la vidéo pourront également être expérimentées.
Le deuxième regard est lié aux imaginaires et s'intéresse aux images qui construisent la mémoire collective et sociale des lieux ;
il interroge les préjugés, les images, les convictions partagées sur l'espace contemporain.
Au moyen d'analyses de la littérature, de la peinture, mais aussi des dynamiques sociales actuelles, ce regard cherche à déconstruire les lieux communs sur la ville contemporaine afin d'en exposer de nouvelles représentations qui en démultiplient la complexité.
Le troisième regard, celui du palimpseste, et cherche à regarder les traces qui ont construit l'histoire, celle de longue durée, des territoires et des villes, est un regard orienté à la lecture de l'espace urbain construit, des « trames urbaines », des « tissus », des espaces publics, à la lumière de leurs stratifications multiples.
Il s'agit d'un regard attentif aux analyses typo-morphologiques, aux transformations et à l'articulation des relations qui s'instaurent à l'intérieur de l'espace habité.
Ce regard s'appuie sur des cartes interprétatives, des cartes et analyses historiques (cadastre ancien, cartes nationales, photographies aériennes, IGN etc.), sur des coupes typo-morphologiques et des diagrammes.
Le dernier regard, le regard territorial, est orienté à l'observation des espaces ouverts, du paysage, des dynamiques naturelles et celles écologiques.
C'est un regard à travers lequel lire les grandes rationalités territoriales :
les systèmes des eaux, la topographie, les infrastructures de la mobilité.
Ce regard s'appuie, surtout, sur des cartes interprétatives à grande échelle, des coupes territoriales, les « transects », de conceptualisations et d'interprétations liées aux différents thèmes et à la littérature disponible.
À travers ces différents regards, tous à considérer comme nécessaires à égale mesure et complémentaires - et non pas alternatifs - le cours vise à fournir aux étudiants les outils pour comprendre l'espace contemporain, le dessiner et l'interpréter, comprendre ses contradictions et ses défis.
Tout.e.s les étudiants et étudiantes se familiariseront avec les outils d'analyse et les regards proposés en réalisant un "Carnet de Voyage" analysant leur espace de vie et ses transformations au cours des 30 dernières années.
This class offers an overview about comfort evaluations in architectural design and suggests passive and low-energy strategies suited to ensure the highest possible indoor environment quality for buildings.
This course addresses occupant comfort, its evaluation and the relevant architectural and technological strategies to achieve a high level of comfort in indoor spaces.
The course is structured as follows:
Theory lectures:
Introduction to the various indoor comfort requirements in buildings and their evaluation:
thermal, visual and acoustical comfort and air quality.
Comfort standards and metrics are introduced, as well as passive design strategies and the main energy targets to be met using active (mechanical) systems when passive systems are not sufficient to ensure adequate indoor comfort conditions.
Main building physics principles are illustrated as well as their application in emblematic existing buildings.
The theoretical lectures will be complemented by the introduction into suitable software tools to calculate and evaluate the indoor comfort and main energy parameters.The theory lectures pertaining to Acoustics and Air Quality will be given as guest lectures by established experts in these fields, respectively by Dr.
Hervé Lissek, head of the acoustic group at LTS2 and Prof.
Dusan Licina, director of the Human-Oriented Built Environment Laboratory (HOBEL).
Individual exercise:
Students will use and get familiar with the presented software tools by working individually on a pre-defined project.
This exercise will be accompanied by dedicated sessions supported by lecturers and teaching assistants.
Project exercise:
The students will work in groups on a small project and will have to evaluate and optimize a building under given comfort and energy requirements.
This group work will be accompanied by two 'desk critique' sessions, where the students will discuss the work and receive guidance from the teachers.
Ce cours adopte une démarche de déconstruction de la complexité urbaine pour aborder l'urbanisme et les territoires, en s'appuyant sur une méthode systémique.
Comme planificateur, aménagistes, ingenieur territorial, urbaniste, specialiste de l'urbain, pour guider et accompagner l'évolution du territoire, il est au préalable nécessaire de la comprendre dans sa complexité.
L'ambition du cours est de déconstruire cette complexité et de fournir des outils pour appréhender les origines et les processus à l'oeuvre dans la fabrique du territoire.
Nous partons d'une même question presque naïve :
« qui est le pilote de l'évolution du territoire pour ré-interroger successivement tous les mouvements à l'origine des évolutions du territoire.
L'objectif de ce tour d'horizon est ensuite de ré-articuler les différents mouvements observés par une étude de leurs relations et de dessiner une systémique.
Les différentes semaines s'articulent autour du triptique forme, pouvoir et usages, utilisé pour théoriser ples différents mouvements qui s'exercent sur le territoire.
Le cours ville et mobilité porte sur les savoirs de base sur la mobilité en partant des modes de vie pour informer l'architecture et l'ingénierie.
Il explore en particulier comment ville et mobilité se coconstruisent.
Les séances s'organisent en deux temps :
(1) une présentation théorique et conceptuelle des transformations récentes en matière de mobilité et, (2) la présentation d'une recherche ou étude portant sur la thématique de la séance.
Ce double positionnement permet ainsi aux étudiants d'accéder à un contenu conceptuel stabilisé et d'appréhender la «recherche en train de se faire».
Les séances abordent des questions de définition de la mobilité, des outils de mesure et de connaissance de la mobilité et des déplacements, des approches renouvelées en matière de choix modal, les liens entre mobilité et modes de vie urbains, et enfin l'action publique dans le domaine de la mobilité.
Centré sur les formes d'habitat des plus pauvres dans les pays du Sud et du Nord et les contextes de crises, en particulier les architectures d'urgence, le cours propose une analyse critique de l'urbanisation du monde au 21ème siècle.
Le cours invite les étudiant·e·s à penser, en circulant des pays du Sud vers les pays du Nord, les enjeux globaux et locaux de l'urbanisation, ainsi que le rôle des professionnel·le·s et des habitant·e·s dans la construction de leurs habitat et environnement.
Il interroge également la possibilité d'autres architectures à partir de cours théoriques et d'expériences de terrain relatées par les enseignant·e·s et leurs invité·e·s, entre autres au travers de projets s'inscrivant dans des contextes humanitaires et de développement, y compris celles liées aux mouvements migratoires actuels.
Le cours se déploie à partir de la notion de « subaltern housing policies » qui invite à interroger les conditions de logement et, plus largement, de vie des populations migrantes précaires qui se tiennent aux marges de l'État social et de la citoyenneté, autant dans les pays du Sud que du Nord.
Nous interrogerons ainsi la relation entre la production de formes d'habitat précaire et la production de catégories de personnes dont le statut de citoyen n'est pas pleinement reconnu.Se plaçant à la fois sur le plan conceptuel et sur celui de la recherche appliquée, en mettant en regard les apports théoriques des chercheur·e·s et les réalisations faites par les différent·e·s acteurs et actrices sociales et politiques, du gouvernement ou non, mais aussi les plus alternatives et rebelles, le cours propose aux étudiant·e·s de procéder à leur propre analyse critique (c'est-à-dire (géo)politique) des mécanismes de production de l'habitat urbain.
Pour cela, il propose d'aller à la rencontre d'autres processus d'urbanisation sur les « bas-côtés » des sociétés urbaines, pour en comprendre la complexité et le rapport aux contextes.
L'UE J initie les étudiant·es à l'analyse urbaine et territoriale à la lumière d'une hypothèse de recherche.
Une séquence d'opérations est proposée:
relevé/description;
identification de principes spatiaux (formes/rationalités/dynamiques);
esquisse de visions territoriales.
FUTURS DES VILLAGES.
Vers une culture des lieux L'injonction à la densification selon le principe du "développement vers l'intérieur", inscrit dans la Loi d'Aménagement du Territoire depuis 2013, semble désormais intégrée par tous les acteurs de l'urbanisme et de la construction - architectes, administrations, clients, opérateurs immobiliers, experts.
Dans la perspective d'une croissance démographique en Suisse, le développement vers l'intérieur oriente l'urbanisme des villes-centre majeures et des agglomérations.
Toutefois, en s'inscrivant dans une approche qui oppose densité vs.
mitage, il se révèle inadéquat au sujet des structures territoriales villageoises en tant que forme d'urbanisation discontinue en milieu rural.
L'urgence de questionner les modalités d'une évolution appropriée des territoires de villages va de pair avec l'urgence de rendre compte de leurs dynamiques réelles ainsi que des attentes sociales.
Dominés par l'espace non bâti et caractérisés par une socialité de proximité, ces territoires ont vu leur attractivité se consolider en contexte de crise sanitaire et climatique.
Les structures villageoises représentent un atout en vue de l'évolution durable du territoire car elles présentent des ressources de régulation climatique, environnementale et sociale qui sont limitées dans les villes-centres ;
en même temps, elles présentent des fragilités, notamment au niveau de la mobilité ou des performances énergétiques.
L'appel lancé par la politique fédérale de la Baukultur (Déclaration de Davos de 2018) au nom des "lieux" et contre une approche des standards ou des modèles préétablis, revêt une pertinence particulière.
En vue d'une croissance démographique des villages, quelle culture du bâti serait-elle non seulement compatible mais aussi profitable à une transition environnementale, énergétique, modale et, plus largement, sociale?
Quelles futures densités pourraient prendre forme sur la base d'un rapport au lieu compris sous tous ses registres - matériel, spatial, culturel, fonctionnel et social?
Quelle culture d'une densité optimale prendrait le dessus sur la tentation simpliste d'une densité maximale?
Quels imaginaires peuvent orienter une vision de l'urbanisation des villages aux prises avec un projet de société pour la transition?
Etude de cas Le cours est organisé par le Laboratoire d'Urbanisme de l'EPFL et l'Institut d'architecture TRANSFORM (patrimoine, construction et usages) de l'HEIA, Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et d'Architecture de Fribourg.
Il se concentre sur l'urbanisation discontinue villageoise dans le canton de Fribourg, notamment dans les régions situées en dehors des périmètres d'agglomération mais marquées par une croissance démographique positive.
Dans un premier temps, il s'agira de faire état des multiples lectures et interprétations de ce territoire, parfois divergentes entre elles, qui ont inspiré la planification officielle.
Ensuite, le renouvellement du regard exigé par l'exposition accrue aux risques climatiques, environnementaux et sociaux, sera poursuivi grâce à une analyse morphologique et quantitative visant à dévoiler les caractères et dynamiques des structures territoriales et spatiales villageoises.
Les étudiants mettront ainsi au point une cartographie qui, tout en prenant appui sur les données cartographiques officielles, revisite les catégories conventionnelles de l'urbanisme fonctionnaliste - habiter, travailler, circuler, se recréer - à l'aune des nouvelles conditions de l'ainsi dite "transition".
Alors que les anciennes catégories étaient au service d'un urbanisme de modèles reproductibles, les nouvelles cartes constitueront autant de portraits exploratoires en mesure de faire émerger d'autres, différents futurs.
Ce cours a pour objectif de familiariser les étudiants à la sociologie urbaine à partir du prisme du logement.
Il permet de naviguer entre les concepts, outils et méthodes qu'elle propose pour penser l'évolution concomitante des modes de vie et de l'organisation spatiale et politique du territoire.
Le cours aborde les concepts et outils de la sociologie urbaine à travers le prisme du logement, en explorant la manière dont les questions les plus intimes du chez soi se lient aux enjeux les plus politiques de l'habitat.
Ce prisme permet ainsi de se familiariser avec les outils théoriques et méthodologiques de la sociologie urbaine, tout en développant un regard critique sur le logement en tant que point d'articulation matériel et expérientiel des enjeux politiques et sociaux qui accompagnent le développement d'une société urbaine.
Traité comme un fait social total, l'habitat permet d'offrir un regard critique, et empiriquement fondé, sur les grands enjeux de société traités par la sociologie tels que l'évolution des formes familiales et des modes de vie, la transformation du rapport au travail, les inégalités de genre ou encore les métamorphoses de l'Etat et du capitalisme.
Dans cette perspective, le cours s'articule autour de trois grands axes:
Familiarisation à la sociologie urbaine et à ses méthodes Introduction des acteur.ice.s et des enjeux qui accompagnent les politiques de l'habitat Introduction de la notion d'habiter et regard sur l'expérience intime de l'habitat et ses contradictions Le cours se construit autour de contributions théoriques proposées à la fois par l'équipe enseignante ainsi que des intervenant.e.s invité.e.s et d'un travail de terrain collectif.
Concrètement, chaque étudiant·e analysera, à l'aide des différents outils d'enquête et d'analyse abordés en cours (revue de presse, observation, entretien..), un phénomène urbain lié à l'habitat (rénovation, transformation, densification, démolition...).
Le but est à la fois de s'approprier les méthodes et les enjeux de la production de matériaux sociologiques, et de confronter les éléments théoriques du cours à des cas concrets.
Des séances d'atelier permettront de discuter l'évolution des travaux de groupe.
Le but est d'avancer progressivement dans la constitution d'une présentation finale qui constituera un premier mode d'évaluation du cours.
Ce travail collectif servira ensuite de base pour un examen écrit individuel qui invitera les étudiant.e.s à mettre en dialogue les cas d'étude enquêtés et analysés avec des éléments théoriques, concepts et lectures abordés en cours.
Au final, le cours doit permettre de construire une lecture indissociablement expérientielle, sociale et politique des formes contemporaines de l'habitat une lecture qui permet de placer les savoirs de l'architecture au coeur d'une critique sociale.
Cours de cadrage destiné à appréhender les questions de répartition spatiale des hommes et des activités d'un point de vue historique Il s'agit, en s'appuyant sur des exemples concrets, d'essayer de déterminer quels sont les facteurs qui influencent la répartitions spatiale des activités humaines, et, à l'inverse, comment ces répartitions spatiales viennent à influencer la manière dont la population réside et se déplace.
Les modèles classiques de répartition des activités (Von Thünen, Weber, Christaller, Alonso-Muth) seront présentés, ainsi que des résultats de recherche plus récents sur les formes d'organisation du territoire dont bien souvent la répartition des activités économiques donne la trame et constitue le squelette.

We are living in an urban world and the design of sustainable cities is essential in order to decrease our energy footprint.
This course provides the instruments to understand the complex urban metabolism, as well as the solutions for planning future smart and sustainable cities.
We live in a world that is more and more urbanised (over 50% of the world population lives in cities since 2010) and architects, urban planners and other stakeholders have to rethink their projects to integrate them to an urban context.
In the architecture curriculum at the Bachelor and Master level, students have been introduced to the fundamentals and principles of building science as well as other courses that focus on the urban scale.
However, none of these courses focus on the physics behind metabolism and sustainability of future districts and cities.
The objective of this course is to provide the instruments to understand and to quantify the urban metabolism, focusing on the urban climate, the buildings energy design and the liveability of the spaces between buildings.
The class introduces the concept of circular economy and its applications to building design, with a focus on design with reused components and design for disassembly.
The class develops critical thinking skills over and above theoretical and technical inputs.
Circular economy consists in maintaining and/or improving the value of products as long as possible, i.e.
by extending or renewing their service live while minimizing resource depletion, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions.
When it comes to building design, a series of sometimes contradicting strategies emerges:
to limit the quantity of used materials, to limit their ecological impact, to enhance the versatility of buildings, and to ensure the future repair, reuse, or recycling of their components.
The class delves into recent literature and practice, aiming at providing the necessary expertise to adopt these strategies in a pragmatic state of mind.
The following themes punctuate the semester:
Circular Economy:
History & Principles Environmental Footprint of Buildings Waste & Recycling Reuse Assessment, Deconstruction & Procurement processes Design for Upstream Reuse (Resuing Structural and Non-Structural Components) Design for Downstream Reuse (Design for Disassembly, Reversible Design, Design for Flexibility, Modular Design) Design with Geo-based Materials New Circual Business Models and Legal Aspects
This course introduces theoretical developments and empirical evidence on city population change worldwide, as well as on its interactions with sustainable development.
Students will learn how to identify sociodemographic profiles of cities to better serve them.
Alongside fast socioeconomic and technological developments, the human population has grown significantly since 1980, from 4.4 to 8 billion in 2022, and its structure or composition has changed, thereby increasing its ecological footprint.
The world population got older, better educated, and more than half is concentrated in cities since 2015.
This course focuses on the human actors of the resulting change in the built and natural environments.
It introduces aspects of population change in cities that are relevant to architects, urban planners, civil and environmental engineers, as well as social scientists.
Students will learn how to identify and draw sociodemographic profiles of urban populations to better serve them.
The course puts the people at the heart of the urbanisation process:
for how many, where and for whom to build housing and infrastructure and provide public services?
Adopting a multiscale spatial perspective, the course offers an overview of theoretical developments and empirical evidence on the demographic dimensions of city growth, the transformation of city hierarchies, the processes of urban concentration, urban sprawl and re-urbanisation, and urban exclusion (segregation/slums).
Various questions will be addressed, such as:
Why is the majority of future world population growth expected to be concentrated in low- and middle-income countries' cities, despite low levels of fertility?
Will cities in high-income countries be at the forefront of the expected world demographic decline?
How do people respond in terms of demographic behaviors (i.e.
mortality, fertility and migration) to the changes in human development and the environment in cities, and how does population urbanization in turn shape trajectories of sustainable development?
The aim is to introduce students to the quantitative data used to characterize city populations and identify human risks and societal capacities of adaptation with respect to changes in the built and natural environments.
Opportunities to explore these data are offered in the form of applied research during lab sessions and the writing of a final term paper.
Topics addressed:
Overview of the international trends in urbanisation and population growth in urban areas Evaluation of theoretical models and the societal determinants of the components of demographic change (mortality, fertility and migration) in cities Examination of the inequalities in population numbers, trends and socioeconomic composition between and within cities Discussion of the interactions between population urbanisation, human development and environmental change Introduction to data sources used to define urban areas and measure changes in population numbers and composition
Urban green offers a variety of services and thus plays an important role in the transformation of our cities.
The course provides an overview of various innovative approaches to the planning and design of multifunctional green spaces, focussing on how to build green and blue infrastructures.
The future transformation of our cities faces a multitude of challenges that make it important to pursue multidimensional approaches:
The aim is to design urban green and open spaces in such a way that they build green and blue infrastructure while fulfilling ecological benefits and, beyond that, various design and social requirements.
As urban areas are hotspots of climate change, they must be designed to contribute to the adaptation of cities to climate change, better retain water during heavy rainfall, and provide habitats for urban biodiversity.
Cities are also living spaces for people, which means that quality of life and fair access to open spaces must be maintained and people's physical and mental health and well-being promoted.
Since space is a scarce resource in urban agglomerations, different requirements often collide in the same space, frequently leading to conflicts of use, for example in connection with densification, for which suitable and cost-efficient solutions must be developed.
In the international context, a whole series of new approaches have developed in recent years that consider the planning and design of green spaces from such multiple perspectives and, above all, in relation to adaptation to climate change in order to establish comprehensive green and blue infrastructures.
Based on the principle of multifunctionality, the course introduces the scientific basis for the fundamental concepts of ecosystem services, nature-based solutions and green or blue-green infrastructure in urban areas.
Building on this, it then uses a broad range of concrete international case studies to illustrate innovative approaches to the planning of green spaces and the development of green infrastructures:
Green spaces and green-blue infrastructures, the ecosystem services they provide and the basic principle of multifunctionality to be implemented Social and governance aspects and environmental justice From large to small scale - green space and green infrastructure planning at different scales, interrelationship between formal and informal planning processes.
Cities in climate change and nature-based solutions to support adaptation to climate change Therapeutic mechanisms and health effects of green spaces, design of green spaces and green space systems to support human health and social wellbeing Analysis and critical discussion of numerous innovative international planning and design concepts for green spaces and green infrastructures (e.g.
green belts, double inner development in the redensification of settlements, picoparks, urban gardening + agriculture, urban forestry + urban rewilding, animal-aided design) Role of participatory approaches
This course provides an overview of global environmental change through the perspective of the planetary boundaries and examines how human health is interlinked with social and ecological contexts.
Students will explore key global problems such as climate change and biodiversity and their links to planetary health, including an in-depth examination of cancer.
The course will give an overview of bioengineering strategies to reduce environmental impacts, the effect of environmental factors as risk factor in cancer development, and the role of metabolic engineering in planetary health.
From week three students will work on a group project based on a real-world planetary health challenge to identify potential solutions to this challenge.
The course is structured in four modules, each led by a different expert:
Introduction to Planetary Health and sustainability (Lecturer:
Nicola Banwell) Global metabolism and food industry impact on Planet Health (Lecturer:
Giovanni D'Angelo) Bioengineering strategies to reduce environmental impacts (Lecturer:
John McKinney) Impact of environmental factors in cancer development and economical sustainability in anti-cancer drug (Lecturer:
Oricchio Elisa)
Epidemiology is foundational to medicine and public health.
This course starts with the key principles of classical epidemiology, progressing through computational modeling techniques, and concluding with the digital approaches of today.
Students will also develop a digital epidemiology prototype.
Digital epidemiology is an incredibly active field, both practically and academically, and it will grow alongside the general growth of technology adoption worldwide - in other words, massively and rapidly in the coming years and decades.
However, one cannot understand digital epidemiology without understanding basic epidemiology.
That's why the course teaches both the foundations of epidemiology, as well as modern computational and digital approaches to epidemiology.
It is designed to introduce the learner to modern epidemiology, and to give an overview of the field, including its most recent and exciting developments.
Students will engage with topics such as:
Core principles of epidemiology Testing and diagnostics An overview of epidemiological study types Insights into infectious disease dynamics Construction and understanding of infectious disease models The role and structure of network models Advancements in digital health monitoring Digital contact tracing The role and development of digital cohorts Privacy and ethics Moreover, an emphasis is placed on applied learning.
Students will be tasked with a hands-on project, giving them the opportunity to develop a prototype of a digital epidemiology application.

Les enjeux environnementaux doivent être abordés de façon systémique.
L'Analyse du Cycle de Vie (ACV) et l'Analyse de Flux de Matière (AFM) sont des méthodes permettant d'évaluer de façon globale les performances environnementales des produits, des services et des territoires.
La maîtrise et la réduction des impacts environnementaux nécessite d'élaborer une vision systémique des flux dans la technosphère et de ses interactions avec l'écosphère.
Après une introduction générale à la systémique et à la systémique environnementale, le cours présente dans le détail deux méthodes de travail permettant la mise en application d'une démarche systémique :
l'analyse de flux de matière (AFM) et l'analyse du cycle de vie (ACV).
L'AFM permet d'analyser les flux et stocks majeurs de système de grande échelle tels que l'économie mondiale, l'économie nationale, les villes ou les quartiers.
Via l'AFM, il sera possible de comprendre le fonctionnement matériel des territoires et des économies, leurs dépendances à des importations, leurs verrouillages face à des infrastructures, les impacts socio-écologiques, ainsi que d'explorer des solutions tant technologiques, de circularité que de sobriété.
Cette méthode sera appliquée à différents cas d'études et il deviendra possible d'émettre un avis critique sur les plans d'actions (de transformations socio-écologiques) actuels, ainsi que de proposer de nouvelles actions.
L'ACV permet l'évaluation des impacts environnementaux (changement climatique, santé humaine, biodiversité), de la criticité de ressources, ou encore de l'élimination des substances dangereuses.
Autant de champs réglementaires ouverts par l'Europe et qui vont conditionner tout à la fois la recherche et les systèmes de production industrielle.
Concernant l'évaluation environnementale, le bilan carbone donne la possibilité aux entreprises de construire des stratégies organisationnelles pour réduire leurs émissions de carbone.
L'affichage environnemental devra permettre aux citoyens de prendre connaissance des impacts des produits de consommation grâce au passeport numérique des produits et d'orienter les actes d'achat afin d'inciter la commercialisation des produits à faible impact environnemental.
Enfin l'analyse des ressources requises par les systèmes de production est analysée tout autant sur le plan de la rareté, de la dissipation ou de la criticité.
Ces évolutions scientifiques et réglementaires sont remises en perspectives avec une vision systémique des enjeux environnementaux de façon que les étudiants et étudiantes puissent développer une vision critique des solutions et perspectives possibles et les organiser pour les rendre opérantes dans un monde contraint et changeant.
En reliant tout au long du cours les connaissances théoriques avec de nombreux cas d'études pratiques et les enjeux environnementaux planétaires, l'étudiant.e développe une vision critique et constructive des forces et limites des approches environnementales tout en acquérant les compétences pour mettre en application l'évaluation environnementale des produits ou services tant pour l'éco-conception que l'affichage environnemental.
Dans une vision systémique, il confronte des approches méthodologiques adaptées pour des échelles de décisions différentes, identifiant par la même occasion les forces et les limites des différentes méthodes.
Ce cours viendra approfondir le cours HUM-126, notamment [CRB1] sur les aspects de la description des enjeux de durabilité au niveau mondial (limites planétaires, justice sociale, approche systémique) en offrant deux cadres méthodologiques quantitatifs concrets (Analyse du Cycle de Vie et Analyse de Flux de Matière) appliqués à différentes échelles de la planète au produit mais aussi à différentes thématiques tels que le climat, l'énergie, la mobilité.

The course will provide the ecological systems knowledge needed to question applied sustainability solutions.
We will critically assess the complexity of current environmental issues, illustrating basic ecological concepts and principles.
The course combines elements of a classic lecture, group discussions, problem-based learning and fieldwork.
Our aim is to balance participants' respect for complexity with a sense of possibility by providing examples from the vast solution space offered by ecological systems, such as e.g.
green infrastructure to manage water.
The class will include three excursions where the students will have the opportunity to discuss critical ongoing problematics faced by environmental managers.
Focus is on lakes, rivers and reservoirs as aquatic systems.
Specific is the quantitative analyse (incl.
exercises) of physical, biogeochemical and sedimentological processes.
The goal is to understand the relevant processes for the water quality from an engineering perspective The themes comprise:
themes 1.
Water, nutrient, oxygen and salt balances (critical loads, one-box models, flux analysis) 2.
Physical conditions of aquatic systems (density, stratification, currents, advection, diffusion, turbulence, heat and gas fluxes) 3.
Mixing regimes (boundary layers, wind and convection, stratified turbulence, double diffusion) 4.

This course teaches how to apply exploratory spatial data analysis to health information.
Teaching focuses on the role of GIS and spatial statistics in spatial epidemiology.
It proposes a context to investigate the relationship between health, quality of life, and environmental characteristics.
This course consists of a theoretical and of a practical part.
Each week 45 minutes of ex-catedra teaching are used to present the history of the discipline (exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial epidemiology), the theoretical background and the main software used.The theory is followed by 1h30 of practical work during which the notions covered by the theory are implemented in the computer lab.
The data used are provided by current research case studies related to environmental health (e.g.
sleep troubles and road traffic noise).
Data exploration, geovisualization, geocomputation, communication (semiology of graphics) and representation (thematic mapping) are implemented in the context of exercises.
In parallel, the data provided and the approaches taught have to be used to write scientific papers (1 short and 1 regular).
This course enables students to think critically about sustainability and to carry out a sustainability assessment based on problems of urban areas.
At the end of the course, students are able to develop their own sustainability assessment using the Sustainability Solution Space methodology.
Sustainability assessments can support informed decision-making, enabling humans to make an optimal contribution to sustainable development.
Although sustainability assessments are widely used, several issues persist:
What constitutes a "good" method for evaluating the sustainability of urban systems?
How can we decide upon what is sustainable, specifically in the context of urban systems?
What role do normative and systemic aspects play in assessing sustainability?
This course is designed to provide students with methodological and theoretical content on sustainability issues, enabling them to conduct well-conceived sustainability assessments for cities worldwide.
At the end of the course, students will be able to develop their own sustainability assessment using the Sustainability Solution Space methodology.
Some of the key questions of the course are listed below.
What is a sustainability assessment?
What are the key sustainability issues in urban areas?
What are the systemic, normative, and procedural aspects of sustainability assessments?
How can we develop policy options using a sustainability assessment
The course introduces the concept of green and blue urban infrastructure in the context of global warming.
It presents knowledge, concepts, and methods for planning, developing, and maintaining an effective network of green and blue infrastructure in urban areas.
With over 60% of the world's population expected to live in cities by 2030, global warming poses a significant challenge to urban development.
However, by positively impacting the urban environment, "green" (plant-based) and "blue" (water-based) infrastructures can help cities adapt and remain resilient in the face of climate change.
Green and blue infrastructure enhances city living conditions by reducing heat islands, controlling runoff water, filtering the air, depolluting water, protecting soil, and promoting biodiversity.
They also provide essential services that support the physical and mental well-being of the urban population.
In many cases, its cost-benefit ratio is more advantageous than that of conventional grey infrastructure.
This course introduces the concept of urban green and blue infrastructure (UGBI) through six thematic modules:
Concept and definition of UGBI 2.
Rainwater management 3.
Mitigation of the urban heat island 4.
Urban ecology and biodiversity 5.
Human health and well-being in urban environments 6.
Climate-resilient urban development.
The course enables students to familiarise themselves with the following issues:
- Urban challenges linked to climate change;
- Ecosystem services provided by green and blue infrastructures;
- Assessment and strategic planning of green and blue infrastructure in urban areas;
- Design, implementation and maintenance of green and blue infrastructure;
- Functional monitoring and cost-benefit assessment of green and blue infrastructure projects.
The course places great emphasis on practical experience and case studies.
It identifies key concepts and best practices for the urban development of green and blue infrastructures.
It features contributions from recognised experts and practitioners.
This course looks at the relationship between our environment - both professional and general - and our health.
What hazards are associated with physical, chemical and biological pollutants?
How can we assess the risks and prevent them?
What health issues are associated with climate change?
This course covers the various stages of risk assessment (identification, evaluation, control) for pollutants frequently encountered in occupational and general environments.
The properties of these pollutants, their pathways of entry or interaction with the body, their effects, their measurement, and the adequate control/prevention strategies are discussed over the course of the semester.
Four main categories of pollutants are covered - Chemical (gases, vapors, liquids) - Physical (noise, vibrations, thermal environment, non-ionizing radiations - Physico-chemical (particles, fibers) - Biological (bacteria, viruses, molds) At the end of the semester, two cross-disciplinary subjects will be covered, drawing on the concepts covered earlier:
the health effects of global warming, and the issue of environmental interventions (interventions in situations of environmental contamination/pollution).
Introduction to economic analysis applied to environmental issues:
all the necessary basic concepts, including cost-benefit analysis, for environmental policy making and its instruments (examples:
climate, waste, mobility).
Introduction to financial calculation applied to project evaluation.
Introduction to economic analysis:
Actors, supply, demand / Markets and prices / Price and quantity regulation Introduction to environmental policy:
Externalities / Cost-benefit analysis, policy objectives Environmental policy:
Abatement costs / Instruments for environmental policy / Comparison of instruments Introduction to financial calculation:
Discounting / Net present value Project evaluation:
Investment, costs (Capex, Opex) / Amortization and depreciation / Financial comparison of projects / Multicriteria choice Concepts are illustrated with examples from Swiss climate policy, waste management, energy retrofitting of buildings, vehicle choice, etc.
The book "Solid Waste Engineering - A Global Perspective" is the basis for this course.
This textbook is an excellent introduction to the field of Solid Waste Engineering and gives insight into relevant solid waste treatment technologies and practices.
Transversal skills will be fostered as well.
With the third edition of Solid Waste Engineering, the authors have decided to expand this college textbook to focus on the worldwide problem of solid waste management.
This change is illustrated by the addition of "A Global Perspective" to the title.
Given that we are currently using our natural resources at an unsustainable rate, polluting our oceans and land with a variety of waste products and altering our atmosphere with gases that are causing further global warming, now is the time to educate future engineers with knowledge and tools to address these worldwide problems.
The 3rd Edition was also adapted in view of the needs of the students who are taking the Solid Waste Engineering course at EPFL.
The course is following the logic structure and the chapters of the book.
The third edition has been rearranged to follow the hierarchy of solid waste management:
reduce, reuse, recycle and recovery.
Thus, students will first learn about integrated waste management strategies, an expertise which will support the future engineer to take measures for pollution prevention as well as for resources conservation.
In chapter 2 the students are introduced to municipal solid waste characteristics, including the identification of different waste components and materials.
Component specific information is needed for recovery, separation and recycling of waste materials.
The relevance of chemical, physical and mechanical properties are discussed in more detail as a basis for the chapters which follow.
These properties are most helpful in order to identify potentially meaningful recycling pathways, as well as to decide about possible technological separation and purification options.
The next chapter is dedicated to the collection of municipal solid waste, a key, but many times overlooked, component of integrated waste management.
Following collection is mechanical processing, in most cases the necessary first step to the recycling and recovery of municipal solid waste.
The students will then study mechanical, biological, and thermal processes.
For each of these topics the authors have dedicated a separate chapter which will introduce the students to the basic principles of these separate disciplines in the context of waste management.
Since not all waste streams can be recovered, students move on to residue management by combustion and landfilling.
Finally, students are exposed to the current issues in solid waste management and the principles of integrated and sustainable solid waste management.
It is recommended to buy the book in advance of the course as e-book or as printed edition.
The book (hard cover edition) can also be borrowed from the teacher for a deposit of CHF 100.
In a few cases the activities at EPFL and the home reading will be complemented with field visits to waste treatment facilities.
In addition a group work will focus on specific waste related aspects.
These learnings will be transcribed into a video so that these group specific learnings can be made available to the other students in this and in future courses.
This course provides the basis to understand material and energy production and consumption processes.
Students learn how to develop a material flow analysis and apply it to resource management cases.

This course presents an overview of (i) the current energy system and uses (ii) the main principles of conventional and renewable energy technologies and (iii) the most important parameters that define their efficiency, costs and environmental impacts.
The course gives an overview of:
Energy systems and uses Thermodynamic, economic and environmental principles relevant for energy conversion systems (energy and exergy efficiencies, levelised cost of energy, emission factors) Power cycles (Rankine, Brayton and combined cycles) Thermal power plants (coal, natural gas and nuclear) Carbon capture, storage and use Heat pumps and Geothermal Wind and Hydro Solar (PV and Thermal) Biomass Energy storage Fuel cells Focus is on the presentation of the current energy system and uses (electricity, heat and mobility) and of the main conversion technologies (thermodynamics and processes) to satisfy our energy demands.
The course does not go in details in the physics of each technology.
The first half of the course is on the presentation of the energy system, thermodynamics and conventional power sources, and the other half on the main renewable sources.
The goal is therefore (i) to describe the relation between the energy system and our demands, (ii) to explain the principles of each energy conversion technology and resources and assess their costs and impacts, (iii) assess their role in future energy systems.
Technology is a driver of long-term growth but it can also undermine sustainable development.
This course introduces microeconomic models of market and collective action failures, models of complex systems, as well as policy portfolios to address these issues.
Technology is a critical driver of long-term welfare.
Yet unconstrained technological development is testing the limits of planetary boundaries and is the source of severe environmental issues.
Technological solutions to such problems often exist in theory but are frequently deployed too slowly to avoid harm.
This course (1) identifies the connections between technology, welfare, and sustainability, (2) models the sources of both market and collective action failures as well as system-level breakdowns, (3) analyzes the demand for sustainable technologies and studies why firms, households, and societies sometimes reject them, and (4) identifies the optimal design of policies to address these challenges.

The objective of this course is to rethink urban transitions by taking a systemic perspective.
It provides the foundation for analyzing and designing urban transitions, integrating technical infrastructure, ecological, and social aspects.
This course offers an interdisciplinary perspective of urban systems and transitions through a qualitative systems thinking approach.
It provides the foundation to analyze the multifaceted nature of urban transitions, encompassing technical urban infrastructure, ecological aspects, and social dynamics like governance and social acceptance.
The focus is set on the interactions between the built environment, the ecological system, as well as actors and governance structures.
Students will engage in analyzing complex urban challenges, developing strategies for sustainable transitions in cities.
Students will gain skills in applying and integrating methods to inform policy decisions and urban planning solutions.
This course equips students with the tools for action and influence within institutional systems, drawing on the fields of sociology, political science, and social psychology.
It explores how to better convince decision-makers, shift behaviors, and design more effective and impactful public policies Introduction :
Presentation and discussion of key concepts and approaches of urban governance (ex.
governance, decision, innovation, institution, decision making, technology etc.) Political systems analysis and policy making :
presentation and discussion of approaches and theories from political science and sociology useful to develop a deeper understanding of how policies are designed and influenced by political systems and institutions.
Decision making :
presentation and discussion approaches and evidence from decision sciences explaining how individuals, groups and governing bodies make (good or bad) decisions and why.
The science of influencing behaviors :
presentation and discussion around the questions "what is a rational decision?" and "are we rational in our decisions?" with contribution from behavioral, psychology, social psychology and sociology.
Ultimately, the question will be :
"how can we influence a decision?" Solution designs and impact strategies:
by capitalizing on the previous sections, strategies and solution susceptible to enhance the chance of positive impact will be presented, discussed and designed.
Each approach and theme will be illustrated with cases studies.
This course explores the connections between spatial justice, social equity, and the socio-ecological transition.
Through theoretical insights and empirical case studies, it provides tools to critically assess urban transformations and imagine fairer and more hospitable cities.
The course is structured around 14 sessions that combine theoretical insight and empirical investigation.
It introduces students to key justice theories (Rawls, Sen, Fraser, Young) and applies them to the analysis of urban processes such as housing, mobility, infrastructure development, and ecological transition.
Particular attention is paid to how technical systems, material infrastructures, and spatial arrangements participate in shaping unequal urban conditions and influence the possibilities for just and inclusive transitions.
Through thematic modules, the course covers topics such as green gentrification, energy precarity, mobility justice, responsible densification, participatory planning, and the management of urban commons.
It explores the social implications of infrastructural and architectural decisions in contexts marked by climate urgency and resource constraints.
Urban case studies from both the Global North and South provide a comparative framework to evaluate the role of planning, governance, and technical expertise in shaping urban futures.
Students are invited to question how material configurations such as transportation networks, energy infrastructures, building standards, and public space arrangements can produce or mitigate social inequalities and environmental injustices.
Students will gain tools to critically engage with the spatial, technical, and political dimensions of their practice, and to design solutions that are both ecologically responsible and socially inclusive.

Restitutions and Collective Synthesis
CMUS will focus on acquiring insights into, engaging with, and modeling the processes of spatial transformation in contemporary societies.
It will integrate statistical techniques and critical urban theory in order to promote socially and environmentally fair policies against the climate crisis.
The formation, deformation, and transformation of inhabited urban and rural places are the result of a complex set of flows, including people, goods, capital, and information.
The (im)mobility of individuals, as well as the transportation systems supporting or impeding them, have become one of the defining features of modern societies, both in terms of their functioning and dysfunctions.
Therefore, understanding and unraveling the ways in which people move in space provides crucial insights into the motivations and consequences of (un)sustainable urban planning practices.
This course will examine how the sociological quantification of mobility infrastructures and patterns can facilitate the understanding of both social and environmental fairness in practice.
The course will build on existing and ongoing research at the Urban Sociology Laboratory and elsewhere to familiarize students with interdisciplinary data collection processes (web scraping, automatic speech recognition, survey design, etc.) and advanced statistical modeling techniques (geometric data analysis, social network analysis, latent variables models, GPS data analysis, etc.).
The course will address a number of topics related to sustainable urban systems, including the carbon footprint associated with home and work locations, the future of automobility in urban environments, the (un)necessity of large-scale transportation infrastructures, the impact of social acceleration and subsequent calls for deceleration, and low-carbon scenarios within urban policies.
The course will adopt the perspective of reflexive quantification, whereby empirical examples will be informed by existing theory drawn from disciplines such as urban sociology, critical geography, and science and technology studies (STS).
This course will facilitate students' capacity for reflexive thinking in relation to their future professional activities in urban planning.
All materials presented in class will be coded in R language and made accessible to students for reproduction.
During the course of the semester, students will be required to engage in a group exercise, which will entail:
1) the application of sociological principles to formulate a problem related to urban sustainability;
2) the identification of the most appropriate methodological tools and data (quantitative, qualitative and/or geospatial) to address this problem;
3) the presentation of empirical results in the context of the existing literature.
Upon completion of the course, students will be expected to demonstrate both an understanding of advanced quantification procedures and a critical engagement with sustainable urban planning theories.

Cities are complex systems shaped by natural, technological, and social factors with historical roots.
Through global case studies, this course will explore how science and technology transform cities into objects of knowledge and intervention.
Cities can be seen as complex systems simultaneously shaped by natural, technological, and social factors, often with deep historical roots.
Reciprocally, cities largely configure how human and nonhuman activities take place in the past, present, and future.
To better understand this double movement, this course investigates how science and technology contribute to transforming cities into objects of knowledge and intervention.
Based on both past and present case studies and on a global approach (comparing cities from different regions of the world), we will study how architects, engineers, natural and social scientists, with their corresponding tools and theories, grapple with a living milieu that, by 2050, is expected to house 70% of the world population.
Throughout the semester we will address three main topics:
Cities as built environments, or how the city is physically constructed through buildings, infrastructures, and urban planning;
Cities as sustainable environments, or how the city interfaces with the natural milieu, sustaining (or not) life through health and hygiene, biodiversity and climatic resilience;
Cities as social environments, or how the city enables certain forms of social life, but also restrain others, through social stratification, mobility, and public spaces.
This course focuses on the strategies and decisions involved in planning future rail systems in an era of decarbonized mobility.
How to enhance railways strengths and tackle weaknesses to gain an understanding in organization and leadership developing the transport systems.
Digital transformation:

This course explores how AI and LLMs can be used to analyze historical urban data.
Students study city evolution (1700-now) through hands-on projects, producing a web interface and a visual booklet based on sources like maps, directories, and cadastral records.
Course Description This course explores how recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), that can be used to investigate the long-term historical evolution of cities.
Through a combination of theoretical grounding and hands-on experimentation, students will learn how to critically use AI tools to analyze historical urban data.
The course is situated within the broader framework of urban systems, where the city is understood as the product of multiple interacting variables such as social, spatial, economic, and political that evolve across time and space.
Urban systems analysis emphasizes the dynamic and layered nature of urban change:
how housing, mobility, commerce, infrastructure, and land use co-evolve, and how such transformations can be reconstructed from historical sources.
The course encourages students to think of cities not only as physical objects, but also as temporal systems shaped by flows, processes, and memory.
Students will work with historical datasets derived from city directories, cadastral sources, civil registries, and historical maps, covering the period 1700-Now.
In some selected cases, datasets extend over even longer timeframes.
The cities studied include Lausanne, Paris, Venice, Amsterdam, London, New York, Geneva, and selected U.S.
cities.
These sources allow for diverse questions related to urban morphology, socio-economic change, demography, commercial activity, and mobility.
The first part of the course introduces foundational concepts in both urban history and AI methods, with particular attention to the functioning and epistemological implications of LLMs.
The second part is project-based:
students will work on their own research question using LLMs and/or statistical tools to analyze the datasets provided.
Each week combines:

A project on the EPFL campus using real data serves as the case study.
This course offers an introduction to urban digital twins, focusing on their theoretical foundations and practical implementations, with a specific emphasis on the EPFL campus.
As cities become increasingly complex, the need for sophisticated simulation and AI-based modeling technologies is more critical than ever.
Urban digital twins serve as integrative platforms that combine real-time data, historical context, and predictive modeling to support urban planning, infrastructure management, and environmental stewardship.
AI-based approaches are now essential at every stage of the design, development, and operation of such models.
Throughout the course, students engage with the principles of creating digital replicas of urban environments that are dynamic, interactive, and capable of simulating real-world conditions.
Topics include recent advances in data acquisition techniques, data management strategies, and the application of AI for design and predictive analysis.
The centerpiece of the course is a group project in which students progressively build a digital twin of the EPFL campus.
This project is supported by case studies based on real data, covering domains such as energy, food, and mobility.
The first part of the course introduces the theoretical foundations and core methods of urban digital twins.
Students explore the conceptual frameworks underlying these technologies and their role in modeling complex urban systems.
Topics include data infrastructures such as GIS, point clouds, and 3D modeling, as well as sensor integration and the fundamentals of simulation and AI in urban contexts.
The second part focuses on practical applications and case studies.
Specific sessions address the challenges of modeling infrastructure systems such as energy, mobility, waste, food and more.
Ethical and governance issues related to the use of urban data and AI are also explored.
This segment is enriched by a series of invited lectures, offering diverse perspectives from practitioners working on operational urban twins in various cities.
These sessions provide students with exposure to advanced AI tools, real-world case studies, and reflections on policy, governance, and digital ethics.
The third part of the course is dedicated to project development and synthesis.
Students refine their digital twin models through iterative feedback sessions, leading to a final presentation.
This project, formatted as an urban design studio, focuses on a specific urban site, engaging with its broader territorial context through an interdisciplinary approach.
Students explore a key urban elements such as mobility, water, or energy at multiple scales, integrating architectural thinking with infrastructural, social, and environmental systems.
The studio emphasizes critical analysis, spatial strategies, and design experimentation to propose context-sensitive, forward-looking interventions.

High-density multichannel silicon probes for electrophysiological measurement of extracellular potentials can provide access to the action potential firing times of hundreds of neurons measured simultaneously with millisecond precision during quantified mouse behavior in sensory decision-making tasks.
Such data begin to offer the first insights into how dynamic brain-wide neuronal computations might underlie simple cognitive functions, and in this course we will explore two such data sets.
We will first discuss relevant literature, and then re-analyse the underlying data to reproduce and extend key published findings.
Guided through discussions in class, students will then develop hypotheses for causal neuronal mechanisms underlying specific aspects of the data.
Finally, students will design new experiments, models, simulations, and analyses to test specific falsifiable hypotheses.

The cell-free synthetic biology course introduces engineers to the most commonly used techniques required to conduct work in Biotechnology and Bioengineering.
Additionally, this course is an experiment in democratizing education and open science by generating useful resources for the local community Note:
this course is limited to a maximum of 16 students The hands-on Cell-free synthetic biology laboratory course will introduce engineering students to fundamental methods and techniques commonly used in Biotechnology and Bioengineering.
In this course the students will generate a cell-free transcription and translation system called the PURE system, which entails learning and performing polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), protein overexpression, protein purification, and other important molecular biology techniques.
The students will then assess the functionality of their PURE systems by quantifying the expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Cell-free systems are becoming exceedingly powerful and therefore popular tools in biotechnology, bioengineering, and synthetic biology.
In one recent example the 2019 EPFL iGEM team who won the iGEM competition that year, developed a cell-free molecular diagnostic kit for the identification and differentiation of two grapevine diseases (see first link below).
In addition, we have shown in the past that cell-free systems are ideal tools for education and teaching by providing local high-schools with cell-free educational kits (see second link below).
The cell-free synthetic biology course is therefore exploring the possibility to leverage the ample resources available in higher education to generate an additional, synergistic benefit for the population.
We are hoping that with this course we will be able to sustainably produce cell-free educational kits for use in local schools.
The cell-free synthetic biology course will consist of a couple of introductory lectures, followed by laboratory experiments.
The students will be guided through all the required steps required for each specific method and technique to generate functional cell-free systems (see third link below for a video guided tutorial published by our laboratory describing the steps required to generate a cell-free system).
At the end of course, if we succeeded to produce functional cell-free systems we plan to package them into kits together with the students of the class and distribute them to interested local high-schools for their use in their biology curriculum.

Le cours propose une introduction à l'histoire contemporaine du Japon et de la Chine:
la réussite du processus de modernisation au Japon, puis le développement du militarisme, conduisent à une confrontation avec la Chine en proie à des troubles intérieurs et au régime des traités inégaux Le Japon et la Chine, 1839-1949 Le cours propose une introduction à l'histoire contemporaine du Japon et de la Chine en se focalisant sur la période cruciale des années 1840-1950.
Chaque étude de cas débutera par une présentation de la période qui a précédé le choc de la confrontation avec l'impérialisme occidental, soit la période Edo au Japon et celle de l'empire des Qing en Chine.
La compréhension des fondements de la société traditionnelle permettra d'apprécier l'ampleur des mutations ultérieures qui affectent les deux pays selon des dynamiques spécifiques :
une modernisation rapide qui permet au Japon de se hisser au rang d'une puissance hégémonique et un long cycle de crises qui plonge la Chine dans les désordres intérieurs, soumet le pays aux ingérences de plus en plus accentuées des puissances impérialistes et, en fin de cycle, permet la montée en puissance du parti communiste.
Ce cours souhaite proposer une introduction à l'histoire des phénomènes médiatiques et de leurs implications dans la société occidentale du XIXe au XXIe siècle.
Il fournit les compétences nécessaires pour comprendre des phénomènes actuels en remontant à leurs origines.
Ce cours, organisé sous la forme mixte, cours ex cathedra et séminaire privilégiant donc l¿échange et la discussion, se propose comme une introduction à un des nombreux aspects de l'histoire des médias.Cette année, nous privilégierons une réflexion collective autour d'un objet spécifique, mêlant musique et image:
le vidéo-clip.
Cet objet sera abordé tant dans sa forme classique telle qu'elle est apparue au cours des années 1970 que de ses différentes matrices médiatiques (depuis les premiers tests de cinéma sonore développés par Edison jusqu'aux tentatives d'imposer un juke box vidéo dans les années d'après la Seconde Guerre mondiale).
Les étudiant.e.s seront amenés à réfléchir également aux différentes déclinaisons directement contemporaines du clip désormais majoritairement consommées sur une plateforme comme YouTube.
Ce cours vise à permettre aux étudiant-e-s d'identifier et d'utiliser les outils de l'éthique dans le contexte de questions sociales et politiques relatives au développement et la mise en œuvre technologique, avec une attention particulière portée à l'intelligence artificielle.
Ce cours se propose d'étudier les notions de base de l'éthique sociale et politique à travers le débat actuel sur les enjeux éthiques et politiques de l'intelligence artificielle.
Au sein de ce débat, on cite souvent des enjeux tels que:
la surveillance et la protection de la vie privée (ou privacy), la responsabilité et l'imputabilité, la transparence et l'explicabilité, les biais et la discrimination, la manipulation et la désinformation, l'impact sur l'emploi et les inégalités sociales, la menace sur la démocratie, la durabilité, l'automatisation de la guerre, l'extinction humaine, mais aussi la perte de compétences sociales et de formes de vies qui nous sont chères.
Mais pourquoi cette liste de préoccupations éthiques et politiques prend-elle la forme qu'elle a?
Quelles valeurs sous-jacentes pourraient la justifier ?
La vie privée est-elle importante en elle-même ou seulement en association avec d'autres valeurs plus fondamentales ?
Quelle valeur est violée lorsque nous sommes manipulés ?
Et quelle serait la valeur de la démocratie (et comment l'intelligence artificielle la mettrait-elle à mal) ?
Et que dire de l'espèce humaine (vu son impact sur la planète) ?
Peut-on justifier sa valeur et son existence sans faire appel à une force supérieure ou à une divinité ?
L'IA n'a bien sûr pas uniquement un impact négatif.
Le fait d'identifier clairement les valeurs que l'on croit menacées nous donnera toutefois une clé pour comprendre son potentiel positif.
Ce cours se propose de présenter les différents droits dont l'individu est titulaire et qu'il peut faire valoir à l'égard de l'Etat.
Garantie des libertés fondamentales et des droits politiques dans l'ordre juridique suisse Introduction au fonctionnement du système constitutionnel suisse.
Présentation - sous un angle pratique - de différents droits fondamentaux consacrés par la Constitution suisse et les textes internationaux ainsi que des droits politiques, notamment le droit d'initiative et de référendum.
Plan du cours :
Cours d'introduction / Liberté personnelle / Principe de non-discrimination / Liberté religieuse / Liberté d'opinion et d'information / Liberté de presse et des médias / Liberté de réunion et de manifestation / Liberté de l'art / Liberté économique / Garantie des droits politiques / Place du droit international.
Identifier et comprendre les débats et problèmes centraux en philosophie de la biologie, notamment autour de l'évolution biologique et de l'émergence du vivant.
Evaluer et comparer les arguments cruciaux dans ces débats.
Synthétiser la discussion et donc formuler et défendre sa propre position.
Etude des thématiques et des positions centrales en philosophie de la biologie Darwin et la théorie de l'évolution L'interprétation des fossiles et les mystères de l'explosion cambrienne La téléologie en biologie (la question du pourquoi) La notion de fonction biologique Le concept de "l'ADN poubelle" (junk DNA) et le projet ENCODE L'émergence et la définition du vivant L'arbre de la vie et le problème de la définition des espèces biologiques Pour illustrer davantage le cours ...
La biologie du 20e siècle a changé nos vies ainsi que notre compréhension du monde.
Ce cours se centre sur des questionnements propres à la biologie, en particulier sur la génétique et la théorie de l'évolution et sur la portée de ces questionnements sur l'Homme et sa vision du monde.
Quelle est la portée philosophique du Darwinisme?
Est-ce que la vie se définit de manière métabolique?
Est-ce que tout organisme fait partie d'une espèce?
Du point de vue méthodologique, notre approche didactique ne suppose pas de connaissances préalables en biologie ou philosophie.
L'objectif principal de ce cours consiste en une initiation à la philosophie en tant que méthode proposant une réflexion critique sur les sciences - notamment sur la biologie.
Retracer l'histoire des genres et des styles musicaux pratiqués au XXe siècle dans le domaine de la musique savante.
Comprendre et analyser les différents langages et courants d'idées.
Connaître les œuvres majeures du répertoire classique du XXe siècle ainsi que les principaux textes théoriques.
La musique Classique au XXe siècle Dans le domaine de la musique savante, le XXe siècle représente un segment particulièrement riche et fascinant de l'histoire.
Caractérisé par un pluralisme des genres et des styles, cette période voit apparaître de nombreux mouvements, écoles, courants, tendances et modes multipliant ainsi les possibilités d'expression tout en renouvelant radicalement le langage musical.
La recherche de nouveaux timbres ainsi que la création d'instruments colorent en profondeur ce siècle aux tendances novatrices teintées de volontés de radicalité.
Ces nouveaux horizons s'inscrivent pour la plupart « en rupture » avec les pratiques des siècles précédents.
L'abandon du système tonal alors en vigueur depuis près de 300 ans induit de nouveaux langages comme l'atonalité, le sérialisme, la modalité, pour n'en citer que quelques-uns et constitue une source intarissable pour la mise en scène des idées musicales.
Une remise en question de la notion d'œuvre et du concept même de musique (avec l'introduction de bruitages ou l'usage de bandes magnétiques et de l'électronique) se manifeste en Europe comme aux Etats-Unis et en URSS.
Les possibilités offertes par l'enregistrement métamorphosent non seulement la conception de l'œuvre mais favorisent également un nouveau type de commerce et de diffusion de la musique.
Si le langage musical se voit radicalement transformé, la notation de la musique, du son, du geste, du bruit exige alors de nouveaux codes d'écriture (notations graphiques).
Parallèlement à ces différents courants musicaux émerge un besoin profond de renouer et revisiter les traditions occidentales des siècles précédents - notamment avec le courant néoclassique, l'apparition d'éditions critiques du répertoire baroque et classique ou encore l'opéra - et d'explorer les musiques folkloriques et populaires des cultures autant voisines qu'éloignées.
Les techniques d'enregistrement, véritable révolution, favorisent non seulement de nouveaux courants et métissages mais aussi des clivages.
Ainsi, une dialectique puissante alliant la redécouverte de la musique ancienne et la recherche de nouvelles sonorités et moyens d'expression signe ce XXe siècle de mille tonalités :
un regard tourné vers le passé comme vers le futur, enraciné dans un présent aux contours politico-culturels tumultueux (instrumentalisation de la musique) et provocant plusieurs scandales.
Ce cours propose une étude des différents contextes, styles, techniques et courants d'idées et des nombreux écrits laissés par les compositeurs eux-mêmes.
Les divers langages musicaux comme la tonalité, l'atonalité, le sérialisme, la modalité seront abordés et expliqués au fil des séances.
L'écoute et l'analyse du répertoire musical des compositeurs actifs en Europe, aux Etats-Unis et en URSS comme Stravinsky, Schönberg, Satie, Ravel, Debussy, Chostakovitch, Varèse, Boulez, Henry, Schaeffer, Cage, Ligeti, Berio, etc.
complètera ce panorama.
Ce parcours mènera à la définition des différents courants et genres tels que :
Expressionnisme Impressionnisme Néoclassicisme Futurisme Minimalisme Musique électronique Musique concrète Musique aléatoire Musique stochastique Ballet
Ce cours-séminaire vise à aborder l'organisation collective du travail sous l'angle sociologique plus que managérial.
Il interroge les passé, le présent et l'avenir du travail humain dans un contexte en profonde mutation.

Ce cours propose aux étudiant-e-x-s un panorama du dessin contemporain par l'exploration et l'expérience, et plus précisément de penser le dessin par l'économie des moyens.
La pratique régulière est accompagnée par des présentations et des références issues principalement du champ artistique.
Du dessin contemporain en remontant le temps jusqu'à l'art rupestre, le dessin désigne à la fois l'acte de dessiner et la forme graphique qui en résulte.
Qu'il soit conçu comme une inspiration ou un concept, il porte à sa surface la trace de son élaboration, il est le témoin des déplacements et des transformations qui le constitue.
Les rapports entre le geste et le résultat permettent l'utilisation du terme Économie pour désigner les relations et les imbrications des moyens utilisés et des sujets de représentation au vu des changements du monde contemporain.
Le dessin comme économie de moyen, mais aussi de temps, d'espace, des relations, des représentations, etc.
En s'appuyant sur l'analyse de démarches artistiques contemporaines, le cours encouragera le décloisonnement des disciplines et la mise en lien de pratiques et de savoirs différents.
Des expérimentations collectives et des travaux individuels traiteront de ces questions pour expérimenter le dessin à partir d'une consigne donnée en s'appropriant diverses formes et gestes.
Le cours vise à faire découvrir les bases du design graphique, ses enjeux, ses différents domaines d'application, ses techniques et ses conventions.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique qui repose sur le développement d'un projet de semestre.
Texte et images - Contrastes et équilibre A partir d'une thématique donnée, il s'agira de produire un système formel et conceptuel avec un contenu textuel, et de créer des images qui illustrent votre intention, votre propos.
Ce matériel graphique sera ensuite mis en page.
L'objectif est d'être capable de réunir du texte et des images en maîtrisant les contrastes et un équilibre tant formellement que conceptuellement.
Le cours propose d'expérimenter les spécificités du design industriel en confrontant les étudiant.e.s à la création d'un objet.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique qui repose sur le développement d'un projet de semestre.
Le projet consiste à réfléchir et créer un objet original et industriellement réalisable.
L'idée étant de considérer et appliquer une approche durable pour sa production ainsi que pour tout le cycle de vie de cet objet.
Le thème précis sera donné durant le cours d'introduction.
Commençant par une phase de recherche sous forme d'une série d'images de références et d'esquisses, la première partie du semestre sera consacrée à trouver un concept personnel et original.
La deuxième partie du semestre sera consacrée au développement de l'idée choisie sous forme de diverses maquettes et tests.
La phase finale du projet sera dédiée à la mise au point des détails constructifs et à la réalisation d'une maquette grandeur nature.
Ce cours approfondit les acquis d'ENV-101 pour mieux comprendre et mettre en œuvre la durabilité :
comment transformer la société vers le bien-être pour tous dans les limites écologiques, avec des approches et solutions sectorielles (énergie, bâtiments, mobilité locale, aviation).
Comprendre les enjeux fondamentaux de la durabilité et réfléchir aux "innovations" économiques, sociales et culturelles requises La durabilité économique et sociale des nations fait référence à leur capacité à soutenir leur existence et développement sur plusieurs générations.
Or, une population mondiale croissante, qui utilise de plus en plus de ressources et émet de plus en plus de polluants pour accroître sa prospérité matérielle, cela n'est pas compatible avec les limites planétaires.
Dans ce cours, il s'agit de comprendre ce grand défi et les arbitrages qu'il oblige les sociétés à faire.
Il s'agit aussi d'imaginer des modes de vie et d'organisation sociétale compatibles avec les limites planétaires.
Il s'agit, enfin, de réfléchir aux manières d'amener les sociétés à choisir des modes de vie responsables.
Le cours n'exige pas de prérequis autre que ENV-101, mais il est relativement exigeant en termes de conceptualisation et de réflexivité.
Il aborde de multiples enjeux concrets, mais ne donne pas de "recettes" à mettre en œuvre.
Il entend former à la prise de recul et à la réflexion fondamentale.
Il requiert donc une ouverture d'esprit et motivation de s'engager dans la réflexion et le dialogue, en classe et en dehors.
Le détail de la structure du cours sera précisé en classe.
En voici quelques éléments indicatifs :
Rappels sur la pensée systémique, les limites planétaires et l'importance de la biodiversité Les modes de production et de consommation compatibles avec les limites planétaires :

CINEMA JAPONAIS, IMAGINAIRES DU DESASTRE :
Ce cours vise à proposer une histoire du cinéma au prisme du cinéma japonais, et de différentes approches critiques et théoriques en lien avec la production de représentations du désastre.
Ce cours-séminaire a comme objectif principal d'introduire aux étudiant·e·s les questions que soulève l'analyse des productions audiovisuels (long-métrages et séries télévisées) issues du Japon et mettant en scène le désastre sous toutes ses formes.
Le cours présente puis discute de différentes approches critiques et théoriques en lien avec la production d'imaginaires du désastre dans l'archipel, notamment à partir de sources d'origine japonaise.
De plus, de manière à donner un panorama de l'étude des représentations du désastre au cinéma dans le champ académique, ces approches seront complétées par une introduction aux travaux issus de la recherche anglophone et francophone.
Enfin, une partie du cours est allouée à une contextualisation historique nécessaire à la compréhension des thématiques et des imaginaires abordés par les productions médiatiques du désastre au Japon.
Dans le cadre de travaux de validation, les étudiants sont invités au travers d'étude de cas à aborder des sujets variés comme l'évolution des représentations du désastre dans le paysage médiatique japonais, les enjeux idéologiques derrière la mise en scène de la crise et sa gestion, le traitement des questions mémorielles, les évolutions techniques et esthétiques des méthodes de manufacture du désastre, etc.
Le cours exige des étudiant·e·s une participation active aux réflexions et aux discussions soulevées.
ATTENTION :
Une part importante des sources primaires et secondaires mobilisées durant le cours sont en langue anglaise et une bonne maîtrise de cette langue à l'écrit est donc recommandée.
Corpus sélectifs de films :
Godzilla, Mothra, Godzilla contre Hedorah, Shin Godzilla, Godzilla Minus One, Rhapsodie en Août, Pluie Noire, Princesse Mononoké, Nausicaä de la vallée du vent, The Man who stole the sun, Barefoot Gen, Le Tombeau des Lucioles, Suzume, Your Name, Japan Sinks, Japan Sinks 2020, Lorelei, etc.
Ce cours cherche à donner, en matière économique, les outils juridiques aux fins d'analyser une situation de fait et de déterminer les règles légales applicables.
Droits et obligations de l'agent économique Le cours traite des sujets suivants :
La liberté économique et la garantie de la propriété telles que protégées par la Constitution suisse.
Les différentes structures juridiques que l'agent économique peut adopter pour exercer son activité (entreprise individuelle, société simple, société en nom collectif, société anonyme, société à responsabilité limitée).
Les principaux contrats qui régissent les rapports entre particuliers (notamment les contrats de vente, de travail, d'entreprise et de mandat) ainsi que la responsabilité qui en découle.
Les principales infractions de droit pénal économique.
Ce cours propose d'identifier et comprendre les débats et problèmes centraux en philosophie des sciences, p.ex.
le débat concernant les différents modèles de l'explication scientifique.
Evaluer et comparer les arguments cruciaux dans ces débats.
Présenter une position/un débat et gérer sa discussion L'explication scientifique, le réductionnisme et la complexité de la nature L'une des tâches principales de la philosophie est de mener une réflexion sur les connaissances que produisent les sciences.
Le séminaire propose une introduction à la philosophie des sciences qui se centre sur les débats philosophiques liés à la recherche dans les sciences dites dures.
La notion de loi de la nature Les modèles d'explication scientifique Le physicalisme et la complétude de la physique Le Réductionnisme et l'émergence Le challenge des systèmes complexes Le plan du séminaire consiste en une introduction par l'enseignant (2 séances) suivie des présentations d'un thème par les étudiant-e-s.
Les textes pour chaque séance seront mis à disposition au début du semestre sur la page Moodle du cours.
Pour illustrer davantage le cours ...
Voici quelques questions qui permettent d'avoir un survol sur le contenu du séminaire :
Quels sont les modèles d'explication scientifique ?
Quel rapport existe entre les différentes théories scientifiques - par exemple, entre la biologie et la physique ou entre la psychologie et la neurobiologie ?
Y a-t-il une unité des sciences qui reflète une unité des phénomènes naturels, voire même une formule simple permettant d'expliquer tous les phénomènes naturels ou s'agit-il d'un idéal philosophique ?
A l'inverse, y a-t-il une diversité de théories et de phénomènes sans relations systématiques ?
Du point de vue méthodologique, notre approche didactique ne suppose pas de connaissances préalables en philosophie - mais nécessite l'analyse de textes philosophiques rédigés partiellement en anglais.
L'objectif principal de ce séminaire consiste ainsi en une initiation à la philosophie en tant que méthode proposant une réflexion critique sur les sciences et leur « prétention » à la connaissance.
Retracer l'histoire de la pratique de l'improvisation dans la musique savante de la Renaissance à nos jours.
Analyser les différents contextes, styles, genres musicaux dans lesquels l'improvisation prend une place importante.
Connaître quelques œuvres majeures du répertoire classique.
Histoire de l'improvisation classique Dans le domaine de la musique dite classique ou savante, la pratique de l'improvisation n'a cessé de faire partie du langage à disposition des musiciens à travers les siècles.
Jusqu'au début du XVIIIe siècle, écrire la musique consistait - dans de nombreux cas - à ne déposer sur le papier qu'une partie du contenu d'une œuvre.
Sur la base de ce « squelette » harmonique, le musicien était libre d'ajouter des ornements, des diminutions, des passaggi pour les parties mélodiques ou alors de tisser des harmonies sur des basses notées au moyen de chiffrages.
Il pouvait également improviser intégralement une pièce ou simplement une introduction (Prélude, Toccata, etc.).
Puis, peu à peu, la notation musicale s'est transformée, laissant la place à l'écriture des formules initialement improvisées tout en préservant des espaces libres comme par exemple les cadences des Concertos.
Cependant, de nombreux compositeurs tels Mozart, Beethoven, Paganini, Chopin ou encore Liszt pratiquaient encore l'improvisation intégrale d'œuvres dans les salons et à l'occasion de concerts.
Enfin, au XXe siècle, outre la pratique de l'improvisation perpétuée par les organistes, certaines pièces entièrement notées portent le titre d'Improvisation.
En parallèle, les nouvelles technologies offrent la possibilité d'enregistrer les improvisations et donc de les reproduire à volonté.
Peut-on alors encore parler d'improvisation ?
L'art d'improviser touche toutes les catégories d'instruments (vents, cordes, claviers) ainsi que la voix.
Plusieurs scénarios se distinguent comme par exemple l'improvisation intégrale d'une pièce, l'improvisation sur une basse ou un thème existants ou alors la transformation d'une musique écrite en ajoutant des éléments improvisés comme des ornements ou des figures mélodiques.
Les caractéristiques de ces différentes pratiques, éphémères et souvent invisibles, sont décrites dans plusieurs ouvrages théoriques (méthodes, traités, dictionnaires, etc.), se reflètent dans des témoignages écrits de musiciens ou voyageurs et apparaissent parfois dans les partitions.
Ce cours propose une étude des différentes traditions et pratiques de l'improvisation de la Renaissance à nos jours à travers l'écoute et l'analyse de plusieurs œuvres majeures du répertoire (Préludes, Fantaisies, Variations, Cadences, Aria da capo, etc.) de compositeurs comme Monteverdi, Corelli, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, etc.
ainsi que l'étude des différents ouvrages théoriques et récits d'époque.
Ce cours offre des clés historiques, politiques et culturelles pour comprendre cette puissance régionale du Moyen-Orient et saisir les enjeux géopolitiques d'une normalisation des relations Occident-Iran.
Ce cours offrira des clés pour approcher l'Iran d'aujourd'hui, à la fois dans sa complexité actuelle et dans sa profondeur historique.
Le cours est structuré par trois thématiques :
le nationalisme, fondé sur la culture iranienne ;
l'islam chiite ;
l'influence occidentale.
C'est à travers ces trois pôles de l'identité iranienne que seront analysés différents aspects de l'Iran contemporain.
Une place régulière sera donnée à l'actualité, politique et géopolitique, afin de connecter les événements aux problématiques abordées au cours des séances.
L'Iran ayant souffert pendant des décennies d¿une image médiatique négative, on s'attachera également à des questions de perception et d¿analyse fondamentales :
comment construit-on l'image d'un pays, quelle image de ses réalités pouvons-nous avoir, que pouvons-nous comprendre d'une autre culture ?
Ce cours analyse les relations Nord-Sud à l'ère des empires coloniaux, ainsi que les dynamiques persistantes issues de cette histoire globale jusqu'à nos jours.
Le cours «De l'esclavagisme à l'impérialisme:
aux origines de la globalisation contemporaine» propose un parcours à travers les grands enjeux qui ont marqué l'histoire globale des relations Nord-Sud à l'époque des empires et des colonisations.
Structuré autour de thématiques majeures, il suit également une progression chronologique cohérente.
Le cours examine aussi bien les événements et les acteurs historiques que les principaux courants historiographiques, afin de replacer les faits et leurs interprétations dans leurs contextes respectifs.
Une attention particulière sera portée au rôle de la Suisse et d'autres pays formellement non engagés dans l'impérialisme, mais néanmoins impliqués dans ses dynamiques.
Le cours sensibilise les étudiant·e·s aux implications de l'émergence de la Chine comme puissance économique et technologique en portant une réflexion critique sur les défis posés par cette transition.
Aspects de compétition économique et technologique Le cours aborde l'émergence de la Chine au travers de problématiques actuelles, telles que les réformes économiques et leurs conséquences, le passage à une économie du savoir ou les limites de la politique industrielle.
Le cours est divisé en 2 parties :
Brève introduction à la Chine contemporaine :
le contexte politique, économique et scientifique (facteurs de succès et défis) Décryptage de phénomènes actuels :
les modèles de production (« made in China » et coûts bas), la mondialisation des entreprises chinoises, la propriété intellectuelle et l'innovation indigène, l'internationalisation du Renminbi, le leadership technologique ou l'enjeu des standards technologiques, le trade-off entre environnement et croissance ou l'exportation du « modèle chinois » dans d'autres pays Vers la fin du semestre, un·e invité·e vient éclairer une thématique particulière (e.g., les start-ups en Chine ou la crypto-monnaie étatique chinoise).
Ce cours aborde les sujets relatifs aux recherches sur les bases cérébrales des actions humaines, en revenant notamment sur l'histoire du cerveau, les changements actuels liés au développement des neurosciences, ainsi que les liens entre cerveau et maladie mentale.
Enjeux et réflexions La psychologie expérimentale et les neurosciences connaissent un essor toujours plus important.
Leurs domaines de recherche s'étendent également aux fonctions supérieures liées aux activités complexes des sujets humains (cognition, émotions, comportements).
Ce faisant, les neurosciences interrogent, voire remettent en question, nos conceptions ou nos opinions, parfois bien ancrées, sur le genre de créatures que nous sommes et sur nos raisons d'agir.
Parmi ces questions, nous verrons en quoi les émotions jouent un rôle crucial dans le processus de décision d'apprentissage.
Nous aborderons également les questions soulevées par les neurosciences sociales.
En quoi les découvertes comme celle des neurones miroirs changent-elles notre vision des interactions sociales?
Quel lien avec certains troubles comme l'autisme?
Ce cours a pour objectif de donner les outils nécessaires à la mise en perspective des enjeux que suscite cette remise en question par les neurosciences de nos manières usuelles de penser l'esprit et les actions humaines.
Il vise également à établir un dialogue constructif entre les sciences humaines et sociales et les neurosciences par des interventions ponctuelles d'experts de différents disciplines lors de ce cours.
Ce cours prend le tabac comme fil conducteur pour explorer les diverses dimensions d'un problème majeur de santé publique et ses multiples implications.
Les enseignants étendront la discussion liée au tabac à d'autres problématiques semblables.
Des questions de santé globale seront abordées.
Introduction générale à la santé publique :La santé des individus et des populations est un élément de base du bon fonctionnement de toute société.
Ce cours examinera les déterminants de la santé des individus et des populations en citant l'exemple du tabac.
Les paradigmes utilisés sont ceux de la santé publique, définis comme la science et l'art de fournir des réponses adéquates aux besoins en santé des populations humaines.
Le cours aborde aussi les changements démographiques majeurs observés dans le monde entier, lesquels ont un impact considérable sur l'organisation de la société, et affectent la santé.
(M.
Bochud, UNISANTE, UNIL) Fardeau de maladie associé au tabagisme (Burden of disease and tobacco) :Le "burden of disease projet" est un projet ambitieux pour mesurer le "fardeau" des maladies dans les populations, les fractions des maladies dues aux différents facteurs de risque ou expositions, et leurs tendances au cours du temps.
Ces variables sont essentielles pour la priorisation des politiques de santé, en particulier, et les politiques de développement, en général.
Des éléments de la méthodologie de ce projet global sont présentés, ainsi que des résultats et prévisions liés au tabagisme et les maladies qu'ils entrainent.
(J.-L.
Bulliard, UNISANTE, UNIL) Histoire de la question tabac et santé :Dans une perspective d'humanités médicales, ce cours a pour objectif de retracer les principaux jalons, débats et enjeux relatifs à la question tabac et santé depuis le début de la fabrication industrielle des cigarettes dans les années 1880 jusqu'à nos jours.
(V.
Ballmer, UNISANTE) Nouveaux produits du tabac - enjeux :Il existe aujourd'hui de nouveaux modes de consommation de nicotine, comme le vapotage, les produits du tabac chauffé et le snus.
Ce cours résume les connaissances actuelles sur ces produits, ainsi que leurs effets positifs et négatifs en terme de santé publique.
(J.
Cros, UNISANTE) Consommation de tabac chez les jeunes :La plupart des fumeurs commencent à l'adolescence.
Ce cours étudiera l'épidémiologie de la consommation de tabac chez les jeunes, à travers l'identification des facteurs de risque, et des facteurs protecteurs contre l'initiation au tabagisme.
Nous examinerons également l'influence des nouveaux produits du tabac, et les principales stratégies pour diminuer le tabagisme chez les jeunes.
(S.
Barhoumi, UNISANTE) Tabagisme, toxicologie et santé environnementale :Ce cours aborde la santé dans le cadre professionnel et élargit les considérants à l'environnement en discutant la composition des fumées et les risques occasionnés aux personnes exposées.
(A.
Berthet, UNISANTE, UNIL) Enjeux environnementaux du tabagisme :Alors que les effets du tabagisme sur la santé sont bien documentés, ses répercussions sur l'environnement sont moins connues.
Ce cours abordera l'impact environnemental du tabagisme aux différentes étapes, allant de la culture et séchage du tabac, à la manufacture, distribution et consommation des cigarettes.
(J.
Martin, UNISANTE) Inégalités sociales et tabagisme :Dans la plupart des pays, il existe des inégalités sociales en santé et dans l'usage du tabagisme.
Ce cours introduira les inégalités sociales en santé ainsi que le rôle du tabagisme et d'autres comportements à risque dans celles-ci.
Nous discuterons des enjeux et de l'impact des stratégies possibles pour réduire les inégalités sociales en santé, en général, et pour réduire les différences sociales dans la prévalence du tabagisme, en particulier.
(M.
Avendano Pabon, UNISANTE, UNIL) Génétique, tabagisme et santé (Genetics, smoking and health) :Le concept d'études d'associations entre le patrimoine génétique et la santé observable (phénotype) sera introduit.
Puis, on décrira comment examiner les variations d'ADN dans la population générale de manière coût-efficacité et dans quelle mesure ces modifications d'ADN influencent les traits humains complexes, y compris l'obésité, la mortalité allant jusqu'à des traits comportementaux, comme le tabagisme.
On examinera aussi comment le génotype peut influencer l'effet de la fumée sur la durée de la vie humaine et la prédisposition génétique aux maladies.
(Z.
Kutalik, UNISANTE, UNIL) Prise en charge médicale de la dépendance au tabac :Le tabac crée une forte dépendance, à la fois physique, comportementale et psychologique.
Ce cours décrit les mécanismes de la dépendance, les bénéfices de l'arrêt du tabac et les différentes interventions médicales et pharmacologiques d'aide au sevrage tabagique et leurs efficacités.
(I.
Jacot Sadowski, UNISANTE) Le droit, un outil pour la lutte antitabac ?
:La réduction du tabagisme dépend beaucoup de l'environnement légal par rapport à ces produits.
Le cours discutera du rationnel et de différents enjeux autour de la législation et des règlements destinés à la promotion de la santé publique.
Le cours examinera aussi la question de "legal illiteracy".
(G.
Marks-Sultan, UNINE) Mesures de prévention du tabagisme :En se référant à celles préconisées par la Convention-cadre de l'OMS pour la lutte antitabac (CCLAT), ce cours discutera les mesures de prévention structurelle et comportementale efficaces pour réduire le tabagisme.
Tandis que les premières (mesures réglementaires et législatives) ont pour but de créer des milieux de vie favorables à une vie sans tabac, les secondes (actions d'éducation, de communication, de formation et de sensibilisation du public) visent à renforcer les connaissances et les compétences des individus.
Les propos du cours seront exemplifiés par la présentation de projets et d'interventions locales, lesquels permettront de discuter les défis et leviers des efforts de prévention du tabagisme.
(L.
Lebon, UNISANTE, UNIL) La consommation de tabac :
enjeux médicaux-économiques :Les enjeux économiques et sanitaires de la consommation de tabac sont complexes et différents selon le point de vue des principaux acteurs:
consommateurs, patients, système de soins, industrie du tabac, collectivité, etc.
Ce cours abordera ces enjeux en s'appuyant sur les outils de l'économie de la santé.
Nous discuterons notamment de l'impact du tabagisme sur le recours aux soins et les coûts de la santé, ainsi que du rapport coûts-bénéfices de différentes mesures de prévention.
Un accent particulier sera mis sur le double objectif de la taxation des produits du tabac:
l'augmentation des recettes fiscales et l'amélioration de la santé de la population.
Nous conclurons par une discussion générale de l'impact économique net d'une régulation plus forte dans ce domaine.

Marti, UNISANTE, UNIL)
Ce cours propose d'explorer le champ des études féministes des sciences et des technologies (Feminist STS) afin d'apprendre à décrypter les enjeux de genre, de race, et de classe liés aux sciences et technologies.
Ce cours vise à l'acquisition d'une boîte à outils conceptuels permettant de mettre en lumière les enjeux de genre, de race, de classe, et de colonialisme soulevés par les sciences et technologies.
Quelles sont les implications épistémiques et politiques de la marginalisation historique des femmes et autres groupes minorisés de la production du savoir scientifique ?
Quel rôle jouent les sciences et les techniques dans la reproduction des normes de genre, de race, et de classe?
Est-ce qu'une autre science est possible ?
Ce cours propose d'aborder ces questions en présentant des auteur.ices fondateur.ices du champ des Feminist STS, ainsi que des notions clé telles que 'androcentrisme', 'savoirs situés', ou la figure du 'cyborg'.
Le cours alternera des apports théoriques avec des études de cas.
Il proposera aux étudiant.es de travailler sur des récits de sciences et de techniques dans des productions culturelles (article de médiation scientifique, de journal, film, série, documentaire) dans le but de comprendre comment ils sont à la fois produits par des enjeux de genre, de race, et de classe, et contribuent à les fabriquer.
Cet enseignement propose de revenir sur le rapport entre compétitions sportives internationales et la problématique de l'environnement (des années 1920 à nos jours).
Dans un but de cohérence, ce sont surtout les Jeux olympiques (été et hiver) qui seront traités ici.
Tout en replaçant cette histoire dans le contexte politique international de chaque époque, l'enseignement s'attache à mettre en perspective historique trois éléments principaux, et complémentaires, en prenant comme point d'ancrage les Jeux olympiques d'hiver et d'été.
Premièrement, il s'agit de mettre en lumière l'impact de ces événements sur l'environnement qui les accueille.
Deuxièmement, de décrire la manière dont le Comité international olympique (CIO) s'empare, ou non, de la problématique environnementale.
Troisièmement, de proposer une « autre histoire » de l'Olympisme en abordant le cas des protestations vis-à-vis des Jeux olympiques.
L'enseignement s'inscrit dans une approche globale et propose un décentrement du regard permettant de stimuler une réflexion autour de la problématique environnementale telle que nous la connaissons aujourd'hui, mais aussi sur l'évolution de ses représentations depuis l'entre-deux-guerres.
L'enseignement analyse la Chine contemporaine, de son ouverture économique sous Deng Xiaoping à son émergence comme puissance mondiale.
Il explore ses mutations industrielles, son internationalisation via le FCSA et la Belt and Road Initiative, ainsi que ses enjeux politiques et géopolitiques intern Il y a près de cinquante ans, la Chine amorçait son ouverture au monde, portée par les réformes économiques initiées par Deng Xiaoping.
Profitant d'une main-d'oeuvre abondante et bon marché, elle s'est rapidement imposée comme l'« usine du monde », produisant des biens destinés à l'exportation.
Cependant, à mesure que son avantage comparatif en termes de coûts diminue, la Chine se réinvente, innove et devient un concurrent redoutable dans de nombreux secteurs.
Aujourd'hui, elle s'affirme comme une puissance économique majeure et incontournable.
L'influence de la Chine ne se limite toutefois pas à l'économie.
Depuis les années 2000, avec la création du Forum sur la Coopération sino-africaine (FCSA) et le lancement de l'ambitieuse initiative des Nouvelles Routes de la Soie (Belt and Road Initiative) en 2013, Pékin déploie une politique étrangère active et stratégiquement pensée.
Ces initiatives témoignent de son rôle croissant dans la transformation des équilibres mondiaux, Ã la fois par la force de son économie et par son poids géopolitique.
Cet enseignement propose d'explorer les fondements politiques et économiques qui façonnent la Chine contemporaine, les étapes clés de son développement, les modalités de son internationalisation et les défis sociaux, environnementaux, technologiques et géopolitiques auxquels elle est confrontée.
Une attention particulière sera portée à la circulation des personnes, des produits, des capitaux et des savoirs, qui illustre l'intégration mondiale croissante de la Chine et permet de saisir ses ambitions dans la recomposition des équilibres internationaux.

l'autre Chine Le retour à la Chine de Hong Kong Nearly fifty years ago, China began opening up to the world, driven by the economic reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping.
Leveraging an abundant and low-cost labor force, it quickly established itself as the world's factory, producing goods for export.
However, as its cost advantage diminishes, China is reinventing itself, innovating, and becoming a formidable competitor across multiple sectors.
Today, it asserts itself as a major and unavoidable economic power.
China's influence, however, goes well beyond the economy.
Since the 2000s, with the creation of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and the launch of the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, Beijing has pursued an active and strategically deployed foreign policy.
These initiatives reflect its growing role in reshaping global balances, both through the strength of its economy and its increasing geopolitical weight.
This course explores the political and economic foundations shaping contemporary China, the key stages of its development, the modalities of its internationalization, and the social, environmental, technological, and geopolitical challenges it faces.
Particular attention will also be given to the circulation of people, goods, capital, and knowledge, which illustrates China's deepening integration into the global system and its ambitions in the reconfiguration of world power.

This course provides an introduction into music theory and analysis, composition, and creativity, and combines theoretical teaching with hands-on practical exercises and music making.
The connection between music, mathematics and the mind is ancient and reaches back to the very roots of human culture.
Throughout history muisc has been explored in a large variety of musical forms and structures.
In this course, we will delve into core concepts of music theory, mathematics and cognition as well as broader questions about aesthetics, creativity, and philosophy, as well as the interplay of art, discovery and formal systems.
Musical theory and practice need to be linked in order to ground each other, and hence this class combines theoretical and practical parts.
On the theoretical side, core concepts from fundamental and advanced music theory will be taught and contextualized in overarching debates.
On the practical side, students will learn and try different musical techniques and apply their theoretical knowledge in practical individual or group exercises.
Every year a different aspect will be at the main focus.
This will be announced at the lab¿s website ahead of the class:
https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dcml/ A practical musical background is recommended for this class (if you are unsure, ask before the class).
This course addresses the theoretical and practical basis of learning and how to facilitate learning through projects.
Active exploration of models, contexts and tools used in project-based learning will help you to develop cognitive and collaboration skills applicable to any project-based context.
Complex problem solving relies on both our cognitive (perception, attention, decision making, etc.) and collaboration skills, in addition to our technical knowledge.This course provides you with a solid foundation to optimize your own learning through projects.
Overall, the goal of this course is to introduce you to both the opportunities and challenges of experiential learning and to equip you with specific skills and strategies to enable you to effectively facilitate your learning in project settings.
Specifically, THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF PROJECT-BASED LEARNING Theories of learning (ie Dewey, Kolb, Lave and Wenger, and Hattie) Social scientific research on the development of 'expertise' and its relevance for designing PBL experiences (Ericsson) Collaborative learning Cognitive biases (Kahneman, Project Implicit) PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK OF PROJECT-BASED LEARNING Models and barriers to team communication (Pennington) Teamwork and collaboration models + barriers (Tuckman) Models and strategies for decision-making and creativity (convergent and divergent thinking) Facilitation models/roles in projects/teams:
group development, conflict resolution, roles, person external or internal to group (POGIL, Belbin, Rogers, Lewin)

Banks, Cows, and Other Dangerous Things (RS11) Each session (except for the first) is centered around one (or two) chapter(s) or some text.
For a given session, you will have to read this text and comment on it (written assignment;
individual assignment).
These comments will build the basis for a class discussion.
This discussion will be moderated by you, that is, a group of students.
Who will be the moderator will rotate across sessions.
In addition, there is a group project.
Students will be divided into equally-sized groups (which implies that group size hinges on attendance) so that each student will be in exactly one group and responsible (with others of the same group) for one the sessions 2-13.
The group of students in charge of a given session will have to read all reflection essays, identify the most interesting ideas / topics, prepare and moderate the discussion during the session.
In addition, they will give a presentation of 15 minutes on a topic related to the chapter that will be discussed in this session.
Practically this will mean that they have to find one (or several) scientific papers on a topic related to the target chapter and then present this (or those) paper(s).
The group may split into two subgroups such that one subgroup is in charge of the presentation of (a) background paper(s), and the other subgroup is in charge of moderating the discussion of the chapter that everyone has read.
Both subgroups will meet with the professor and/or the teaching assistant and present what they have prepared for "their" session.
In this coaching session they will receive feedback that will, ideally, help them to do a better job in class.
Ce cours est une introduction à la linguistique, discipline qui étudie les unités et les règles des langues humaines et rend compte de leur fonctionnement et de leurs fonctions.
Le cours revient tout d'abord sur des notions familières (langue, langage, signe, communication) pour en circonscrire la définition et permettre une approche proprement scientifique du fait linguistique.
Le cours procède ensuite à l'examen des traits structuraux et fonctionnels généralement associés aux langues naturelles et compare celles-ci à d'autres systèmes de communication.
Puis, le cours présente les différents niveaux d'analyse qui structurent la description des langues humaines :
niveau phonologique (les 'sons'), niveau morphologique (les 'mots') et niveau syntaxique (les 'phrases').
Enfin, le cours se clôt par des considérations sur les rapports entre système linguistique et situation d'énonciation, ceci impliquant non seulement d'envisager la façon dont l'information véhiculée par les unités linguistiques est affectée par le contexte (et réciproquement) mais aussi d'aller au-delà de la description des sons, des mots et des phrases pour comprendre comment se structurent les textes et les interactions verbales.
À l'issue de cet enseignement, les étudiant·e·s sauront expliquer ce qui caractérise les systèmes linguistiques et employer les outils nécessaires à leur analyse.
Ce cours présente des clés d'analyse des sciences humaines pour réfléchir aux infrastructures, de leur planification à leur gouvernance.
Il abordera les enjeux d'écologie, d'accessibilité, de contestation, des risques, ou encore de citoyenneté à partir de différentes études de cas.
Les infrastructures - leur présence, leur absence et leurs impacts - sont au centre de nombreux débats et défis contemporains.
Des routes aux barrages, de la gestion des déchets à internet, les infrastructures portent des enjeux de plus en plus nombreux.
Ce cours offre des clés pour décrypter et comprendre certains de ces enjeux comme l'écologie, l'accessibilité, la contestation, les risques, la sécurité ou encore la citoyenneté, à partir des sciences humaines et sociales.
Nous examinerons ce que sont les infrastructures, comment elles sont conçues, mises en place et gérées, et comment elles sont en relation avec les systèmes sociaux, les régimes politiques et l'environnement.
Pendant le semestre, nous essayerons de comprendre les géographies inégales et différenciées des infrastructures et comment diverses structures hiérarchiques - telles que la race, la classe et le sexe - y sont imbriquées.
Les séances seront organisées par thématiques et alterneront perspectives théoriques et études de cas.
Le cours présente les enjeux mondiaux actuels liés à la communication instantanée et aux médias sociaux.
L'approche interdisciplinaire intègre les SHS et les sciences de l'ingénieur et initie au travail de groupe et à la démarche scientifique.
Ce cours vise à appréhender les enjeux et à développer l'esprit critique liés aux systèmes d'information et de communication.
Il vise également à développer des compétences transversales comme la capacité à collaborer, à réaliser des projets interdisciplinaires, à communiquer ses idées, ainsi qu'à gérer l'information et la littérature scientifique.
Après une introduction aux enjeux mondiaux, la première partie du cours portera en particulier sur les thématiques suivantes liées à la communication et à ses liens avec les objectifs de développement durable (SDGs):
Accès à l'information - Surcharge d'information, filtrage, qualité et véracité de l'information, processus de formation d'opinion.
Médias sociaux - Protection de la sphère privée, réputation, confiance, approche critique des plates-formes, entrepreunariat numérique.
Intelligence artificielle - Réglementation, éthique, transparence et explicabilité, souveraineté numérique.
Partage de l'information - Propriété intellectuelle, piratage, modèles d'affaire adaptés à l'âge numérique, motivation, contenu gratuit partage (open content and creative commons), cocréation (Wikipédia).
Sagesse de la foule - Prise de décision collective, débats, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, e-democracy, leadership, communication de masse.
Gestion des connaissances - Echanges nord sud, dissémination du savoir, plates-formes favorisant le changement de comportement éthique, environnemental et éducatif.
Communication et réseaux de demain - Villes intelligentes, Internet des objets, réseaux de capteurs, réseaux adhoc, plates-formes pair-à-pair, impact sur l'urbanisme, les transports ou la santé.
Un examen de mi-semestre portant sur la rédaction individuel d'un essai sera organisé.
La seconde partie du cours sera dédiée au travail en groupe et à la présentation d'un poster résumant le travail en groupe.
Ce cours intègre les SHS avec les sciences de l'ingénierie et initie au décryptage des enjeux sociaux, techniques et politiques en lien avec l'intelligence artificielle.
L'intelligence artificielle contemporaine - entendue comme l'ensemble des méthodes informatiques de calcul basées sur de l'apprentissage statistique massif - bouleverse nos façons de décrire et d'échanger sur le monde.
Mais qui est-ce qui façonne l'intelligence artificielle ?
Comment est-elle discutée/disputée ?
Et sur quels fondements techniques, sociaux et politiques repose-t-elle ?
Au cours de six séances ex cathedra, les enseignants présenteront une série de notions, issues des SHS et des sciences de l'ingénierie, permettant de saisir les mécanismes à la fois techniques et sociaux qui nourrissent l'essor actuel de l'intelligence artificielle.
Ces notions serviront d'outils pour explorer et analyser en groupe une controverse actuelle impliquant des technologies d'intelligence artificielle.Le cours est majoritairement en français, avec des passages en anglais.
Session 1 :
Intelligence artificielle et analyse de controverseOù les enseignants commencent par introduire le cours, sa thématique, son organisation et son mode d'évaluation, avant de présenter la notion de controverse sociotechnique, qui va constituer un des principaux outils méthodologiques pour les travaux de groupe des étudiants.
Session 2 :
La loi de Moore et la notion de promesses technoscientifiquesOù les enseignants présentent la notion de promesse techno-scientifique, un outil rhétorique qui participe grandement aux discours actuels autour l'intelligence artificielle.
Pour illustrer plus avant leur propos, ils présentent ensuite l'histoire mouvementée de la 'loi de Moore' censée régir l'intégration exponentielle des transistors au sein des circuits électroniques.
Session 3 :
Deep neural networks IOù les enseignants retracent l'histoire sociotechnique des deep neural networks (réseaux de neurones profonds), à l'origine d'une disruption technique à l'orée des années 2010.
Session 4 :
Deep neural networks IIOù les enseignants continuent de retracer l'histoire sociotechnique des deep neural networks, en s'attardant cette fois-ci sur les réseaux récurrents et leurs successeurs - qui continuent aujourd'hui de défier la chronique - les transformers (modèles auto-attentifs).
Session 5 :
Supervision et apprentissage statistiqueOù les enseignants se concentrent sur la notion de supervision, centrale aux mécanismes d'apprentissage statistique.
Ce qui leur fait traiter de près la notion concomitante de 'ground truth' (vérité terrain) ainsi que les enjeux tout à fait mondiaux qui lui sont attachés.
Session 6 :
IA génératif et sphère informationnelleOù les enseignants se penchent sur les nouveaux outils génératifs permettant la production massive de contenus non véridiques, ainsi que ses conséquences - réelles ou fantasmées - sur la sphère informationnelle au sens large.
La recherche et l'analyse d'informations certifiées sont également des compétences essentielles.
Les étudiants apprendront à rechercher efficacement la littérature savante et journalistique ainsi qu'à citer correctement leurs sources.
Comment la science et la technologie peuvent répondre à l'extrême vulnérabilité causée par la pauvreté, les crises et les conflits dans un contexte de changement climatique.
Le cours explore les principes clés pour concevoir des solutions durables et adaptées aux besoins des populations touchées.
Ce cours explore l'intersection entre la science, la technologie et la vulnérabilité humaine extrême, en se concentrant sur la manière dont les avancées technologiques peuvent à la fois atténuer et aggraver les risques auxquels sont confrontées les populations vulnérables.
Le cours commence par une présentation du contexte de la vulnérabilité extrême et de ses trois causes principales :
1) la pauvreté extrême, 2) les crises humanitaires, et 3) les conflits armés et la violence.
À travers des exemples pratiques, les étudiants apprendront à identifier et comprendre les écueils méthodologiques auxquels les ingénieurs et les scientifiques doivent prêter attention lorsqu'ils conçoivent des solutions pour les populations vulnérables.
À la fin du cours, les étudiants auront acquis une compréhension critique des défis liés à la réduction de la vulnérabilité extrême, et de la manière dont ils peuvent contribuer, par la science et la technologie, à la construction de sociétés plus résilientes et pacifiques.
Ce cours explore la signification de l'égalité, sa réalisation dans la société et sa relation avec la technologie.
Égalité et justice Apprendre à identifier des valeurs (comme l'égalité) Comprendre comment des valeurs se réalisent au sein de pratiques sociales (y compris la pratique de la recherche scientifique).
Égalité de statut ou relationnelle VS d'autres types d'égalité (de possession de ressources;
des chances) Égalité, discriimination, et justice Inégalité entre les genres (inégalités dans le pouvoir de décision, professionnelles, politiques, justice reproductive, violence, etc.);
Les normes, les institutions, et les développements technologiques (à petite et à grande échelle) qui ont historiquement défavorisé l'égalité des genres Les développements technologiques susceptibles de réaliser l'égalité des genres dans le présent et dans le futur

L'objectif de ce cours est d'étudier les différentes manifestations des mondes totalitaires dans la (science-)fiction.
Plus précisément, nous regarderons comment les écrivains racontent l'aliénation de l'homme au numérique - ainsi que les fonctions anthropologiques de tels récits.
Qui ne connaît pas l'expression "Big Brother is watching you"?
Et il est à fort à parier que 1984, Fahrenheit 451, V pour Vendetta ou Divergent soient des titres qui sont familiers à la plupart d'entre vous.
C'est pourquoi, dans ce cours, nous chercherons à:
- Apprendre à délimiter et définir un genre littéraire (la science-fiction dystopique) à partir de plusieurs textes différents.
- Étudier de manière approfondie la façon dont les récits se construisent:
créer un cauchemar social ne se fait pas n'importe comment et sert des objectifs bien précis.
- Analyser plusieurs textes qui traitent la question des impacts néfastes du numérique et observer comment ils mélangent contexte historique, création littéraire - et à quelles fins.
Le cours sera structuré entre des enseignements théoriques visant à acquérir des outils d'analyse appropriés aux textes parcourus (création de mondes, mises en scène de l'aliénation, éléments extrapolés) et des exercices pratiques (lecture de textes, réflexion sur les textes, lien avec le monde quotidien) conduisant l'étudiant.e à s'appuyer sur ces outils afin de mieux saisir le sens des textes étudiés.
Le cours explore comment les technologies façonnent nos corps, nos désirs et nos imaginaires, en s'appuyant sur la performance comme outil critique.
Ce cours propose d'explorer les pratiques artistiques performatives qui se déploient dans les milieux médiatiques :
à travers les écrans, en réseau, ou encore par le code.
Il s'agira d'examiner comment nos écologies techniques influent sur nos perceptions, nos corps, nos subjectivités, nos capacités d'agir et de désirer, mais aussi d'expérimenter des pratiques d'action et de performance qui pourront impliquer des corps présents ou absents, réels ou simulés ;
qui engageront quoi qu'il en soit des dispositifs techniques comme médium critique et poétique.
En filigrane, ce cours s'appuiera sur les concepts de technogenèse (N.
Katherine Hayles) et de cosmotechnologie (Yuk Hui) pour explorer les enchevêtrements entre nature et culture technique, humain et non-humain, en délaissant les cadres épistémologiques qui les ont historiquement opposés.
Nous examinerons l'interdépendance de la vie humaine, « enchâssée dans un monde matériel d'une grande complexité, monde dont dépend notre survie » (Hayles) et regarderons ce que le récit technologique occidental raconte comme histoires.
Nous remarquerons, par exemple, qu'en glorifiant une abstraction désincarnée et « neutre » de la technologie, ce récit dissimule les infrastructures matérielles, les corps qu'elle mobilise, ainsi que les violences écologiques, sociales et politiques qu'elle perpétue.
Il s'agira donc d'une part de saisir ces logiques, et de poser les bases d'une critique de la manière dont la technologie façonne nos vies et nos imaginaires.
D'autre part, par les moyens de l'art et particulièrement de la performance, les étudiant-xes seront invité-e-x à produire des contre-fictions et des contre-dispositifs à partir des outils du quotidien (smartphones, ordinateurs, réseaux, objets connectés, etc.).
Ces expérimentations, qu'elles prennent la forme de performances filmées, d'interventions numériques, de conversations en ligne ou de lectures augmentées, chercheront à désamorcer les futurs tracés par le récit technologique dominant, et à révéler des perspectives alternatives pour repenser les rapports de pouvoir qui se jouent au sein de nos corps prolongés par nos dispositifs techniques.
Ce cours propose une introduction aux fondamentaux techniques, sociaux et économiques de l'énergie.
On examinera le cas concret de la fusion nucléaire.
Comment cette énergie pourrait remodeler notre monde?
Comment garantir son acceptabilité, son intégration structurelle et sa viabilité économique?
Le secteur de l'énergie est stratégique, car il alimente l'économie.
Toutefois, il engendre également des impacts environnementaux et sociétaux croissants.
La transition vers des technologies plus propres s'impose, mais son rythme est insuffisant.
Pour atteindre les objectifs de développement durable, l'innovation est donc cruciale.
L'innovation ne se résume pas à l'aspect technologique.
Bien que plusieurs solutions existent, leur mise en œuvre reste souvent trop lente, freinée par des obstacles économiques et sociétaux.
Il est donc essentiel que les avancées techniques s'accompagnent de nouvelles approches sociales et économiques.
Ce cours proposera d'abord une introduction aux fondamentaux techniques, sociaux et économiques de l'énergie.
Puis, on examinera des cas concrets, comme celui de la fusion.
Comment cette révolution pourrait-elle remodeler notre monde?
Comment garantir son acceptabilité sociale, son intégration dans les infrastructures actuelles et sa viabilité économique?
Le début du semestre sera consacré aux méthodes que les étudiant.e.s pourront appliquer dans d'autres contextes.
La deuxième partie portera sur la création d'un poster traitant d'un sujet énergétique.
Ce cours porte sur la transition énergétique d'un système fondé sur les énergies fossiles vers un modèle reposant sur des sources d'énergie décarbonées, la sobriété et l'efficacité, et met l'accent sur les principaux enjeux technologiques, socio-économiques et géopolitiques y étant associés.
Le cours donne une vue d'ensemble des éléments suivants :
Concepts principaux de l'énergie (énergie, puissance, rendement, facteur de charge, coût nivelé de l'énergie, facteurs d'émission) Le système énergétique :
de la production à la conversion et à l'usage Place de la consommation énergétique dans notre quotidien et de chaque secteur (sobriété, efficacité et substitution énergétique) Lien entre consommation d'énergie et impacts environnementaux, conséquences du changement climatique et dernières actualités Enjeux technologiques des énergies fossiles et décarbonées Enjeux économiques (évolution des coûts), sociaux (acceptation) et politiques (indépendance et résilience) L'accent est mis sur la présentation du système énergétique actuel et de ses utilisations (électricité, chaleur et mobilité), des technologies de conversion pour satisfaire nos demandes en énergie, des impacts environnementaux associés et des différents enjeux.
La première moitié du cours est consacrée à des séminaires et questionnaires sur ces thèmes, la seconde moitié à un travail de groupe sur un thème proposé par les étudiant-e-s et validé par les enseignant-e-s.
La « Pop Culture » a toujours abondamment puisé, et puise encore, dans les mythes et les figures de la Méditerranée antique.
L'Egypte, la Grèce, Rome inspirent aussi bien les jeux vidéo que les films, séries, BD ou romans grand public.
L'enjeu du cours sera de faire l'analyse d'une œuvre de ce type.
Les premieÌres lecÌ§ons preÌsenteront divers exemples et modeÌles dâanalyse, ressortissant aux aires culturelles du cours.
En paralleÌle, les eÌtudiantÂ·eÂ·s formeront des groupes.
Chaque groupe choisira librement une Åuvre contemporaine, ouvertement inspireÌe par les mythes et reÌcits de lâantiquiteÌ meÌditerraneÌenne.
Dans la suite du semestre, chaque groupe concevra une preÌsentation orale.
Il y preÌsentera le mateÌriau antique dont lâÅuvre Â« Pop Culture Â» est inspireÌe, en sâappuyant sur une litteÌrature acadeÌmique de qualiteÌ.
Il sâattachera ensuite aÌ faire apparaiÌtre les motifs culturels propres aÌ notre eÌpoque qui lâimpreÌgnent.
Les preÌsentations se feront en classe, devant les autres eÌtudiantÂ·eÂ·s.
Ce format permettra aÌ lâensemble de la classe, sous la conduite des enseignantÂ·eÂ·s, de discuter des apports et des limites du travail preÌsenteÌ, en regard de leurs eÌtudes respectives.
Nous deÌvelopperons ainsi un regard critique commun sur les preÌjugeÌs et les valeurs normatives, Â« eÌvidences Â» invisibles dont notre culture, comme toute autre, est porteuse.
Ce cours vise à aborder les œuvres du scénariste de comics Alan Moore, sûrement le scénariste le plus influent de tous les temps, et de se familiariser avec des concepts d'analyse de la bande dessinée, des plus simples aux plus complexes, afin de montrer la richesse de ce médium.
Sommaire du cours :
- Histoire du comic book et du graphic novel (2 séances) - Qui est Alan Moore ?
(1 séance) - Analyse de V pour Vendetta (2 séances) - Analyse de Watchmen (2 séances) - Analyse de Killing Joke (2 séances) - Analyse de Promethea (2 séances) - Analyse du Neonomicon (2 séances) - Conclusion (1 séance)
Cet enseignement analysera les genres littéraires de l'utopie et de la dystopie au prisme de l'écopoétique et des enjeux environnementaux, dans un corpus de romans francophones qui croisera la science-fiction, le récit d'anticipation et la fiction post-apocalpytique.
Ce cours questionnera les littératures contemporaines de l'imaginaire et leurs mondes fictifs sous l'angle des crises environnementales de l'Anthropocène.
Il s'intéressera aux expériences de pensée et d'écriture des fictions spéculatives qui contribuent à inventer, modéliser, refigurer d'autres conceptions de l'environnement et d'être au monde, en dépassant un système de rationalité cartésienne et plus généralement occidental qui a fixé la dichotomie des humains comme "maîtres et possesseurs de la nature" (Descartes, Discours de la méthode).
Dans un parcours littéraire de romans francophones contemporains qui passera par la science-fiction, le récit d'anticipation politique et la fiction post-apocalpytique, cet enseignement se focalisera sur les dimensions utopiques et dystopiques des mondes imaginaires, c'est-à-dire sur les sociétés idéales et leurs renversements cauchemardesques construits par les intrigues.
En quoi ces romans nous amènent-ils, nous lecteurs et lectrices, à nous défamiliariser d'un rapport de domination et à nous décentrer en faveur du vivant?
Comment écrire avec, et pour l'environnement, et avec quels moyens ou procédés littéraires?
Dans nos analyses textuelles, nous nous pencherons en particulier sur les inventions de mondes utopiques/dystopiques, sur les processus d'immersion et d'identification aux personnages, et sur les sollicitations de notre empathie.
This course explores how data from digital interactions can be analyzed to improve design, usability, and engagement.
Students will learn quantitative methods to collect, organize, and interpret data, generating insights to enhance digital services and user experiences.
In today's UX practice, understanding the impact of our design decisions at scale is more crucial than ever.
While qualitative insights help us explore user motivations and pain points, it's through quantitative methods that we validate, generalize, and optimize our work.
This course introduces students to the core principles and techniques of quantitative UX research.
From foundational statistics to experimental testing and data visualization, you'll gain hands-on experience using data to inform design choices.
Whether you're conducting surveys, analyzing user behavior through analytics, or quantifying feedback, this course equips you with the tools to make evidence-based decisions and communicate findings with confidence.
ContentThe course will start providing a basic perspective on usability and heuristics of design to move progressively towards the quantitative analysis of the user interaction with a digital service.
The following topics will constitute the backbone of the course:
Introduction to UX and Research Methods Statistics and Quantitative Analysis Designing UX Research Studies Early-Stage UX Testing Techniques Survey Design and Evaluation Usability Metrics and Frameworks Web and App Analytics A/B and Multivariate Testing Quantifying and Visualizing Qualitative Data Storytelling with Data
This course examines the intersection of international economic relations and geopolitical conflict.
We discuss trade networks, financial sanctions, and strategic alliances as instruments of power in an era of economic warfare.
Colour is believed to influence one's well-being and emotions, but not all claims are scientifically sound.
We teach students basic skills to critically evaluate such ideas by analysing empirical studies in psychology.
Colour is widely considered to be powerful in shaping psychological processing.
Popular media frequently report on how colour influences emotions and fosters well-being.
However, many of these claims are based on marketing strategies and not empirical findings.
When looking at the existing literature, these claims are less convincing, or rather, the evidence for many claims is yet missing.
The current seminar will introduce and discuss ways to study and test the relationships between colour and psychological functioning.
With psychological functioning we refer to cognitive domains such as intelligence, learning and memory, language, emotion, perception, personality, and others.
The discussions will be based on empirical studies.
The objective of the course is for students to become aware of problems of causality, proof of popular statements and critical thinking regarding statements that can be widely read and heard in the public domain.
Ce cours constitue une introduction à l'approche sociologique de la culture à travers l'analyse du secteur des jeux vidéo.

Le cours vise à faire découvrir les bases du design graphique, ses enjeux, ses différents domaines d'application, ses techniques et ses conventions.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique qui repose sur le développement d'un projet de semestre.
Identité visuelle Sur la base d'une thématique donnée, le projet consistera à élaborer les différents éléments d'une identité visuelle en produisant un matériel graphique, présenté ensuite dans une édition ou sur une affiche.
Le cours propose d'expérimenter les spécificités du design industriel en confrontant les étudiant-e-s à la création d'un objet.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique qui repose sur le développement d'un projet de semestre.
Le projet consiste à imaginer et créer un objet fonctionnel et de définir sa forme la plus adaptée par rapport à son usage.
Tout en développant son language visuel, original et esthétiquement séduisant la question sur le choix du matériau et du procédé de fabrication sera également abordée.
Le thème précis sera donné durant le cours d'introduction.
Commençant par une phase de recherche sous forme d'une série d'images de références et d'esquisses, la première partie du semestre sera consacrée à trouver un concept personnel et original.
La deuxième partie du semestre sera consacrée au développement de l'idée choisie sous forme de diverses maquettes et tests.
La phase finale du projet sera dédiée à la mise au point des détails constructifs et à la réalisation d'une maquette grandeur nature.

The proposed course provides an introduction to international human rights law (IHRL), its interpretation and mechanisms, and analyses its interactions with the use of digital solutions and AI in healthcare The course will be structured in three parts.
In the first part, students will be introduced to international human rights law, exploring its evolution, foundational principles, the nature of State obligations, responsibilities of private actors, and their implications regarding algorithmic accountability in the development and use of digital health solutions.
The second part will focus on a detailed examination of specific substantive rights, applied in the context of digital health.
In particular, the right to private life and data protection, the right to health, and the right to be free from discrimination will be scrutinised in the context of challenges posed by personalised medicine and AI, including algorithmic biases.
Cultural rights and acceptability of digital solutions will also be analysed.
Finally, the third part will discuss the implementation and enforcement of international human rights law.
Cet enseignement propose une approche matérielle et environnementale des images et des medias du XIXe au XXIe siècle (lanterne magique, photographie, cinéma, médias numériques, IA, etc.).
Cet enseignement offre un parcours dans l'histoire des images et des medias du XIXe au XXIe siècle (lanterne magique, photographie, cinéma, medias numériques, IA, etc.).
Il propose une approche matérielle et environnementale des images afin de rendre compte aussi bien de la dimension élémentaire de leur fabrication que de leurs espaces sociaux de consommation.
Le cours se veut une introduction à la culture visuelle moderne à partir de composantes et d'usages de base des images.
Il inclut une participation active à la recherche et à la manipulation d'images.
Chaque séance comprend aussi la projection d'extraits de films commentés en classe.
Ce cours porte sur les débats et théories autour du concept d'Anthropocène.
Il propose une analyse critique des origines humaines du changement climatique et explore les implications politiques de ce phénomène pour la gestion de l'environnement global.
L'idée de l'Anthropocène propose une nouvelle époque géologique succédant à l'Holocène, où les humains seraient les principales forces de changement sur la planète.
Il serait caractérisé par des massives transformations anthropiques à l'échelle planétaire du système Terre, comprenant la perturbation des cycles biogéochimiques de la Terre, l'épuisement des réserves minérales et des ressources en eau, le changement massif d'affectation des sols, l'accumulation de gaz à effet de serre dans l'atmosphère, l'altération des habitats côtiers et marins, ainsi que l'extinction de nombreuses espèces.
Les sciences naturelles ont considérablement enrichi notre compréhension de l'impact humain sur le système terrestre.
Toutefois depuis une vingtaine d'années, cette proposition suscite de nombreux débats parmi les scientifiques, les intellectuels et le grand public.
Pour saisir pleinement les origines de cette crise, il est essentiel de se tourner vers les sciences humaines et sociales, qui révèlent les rapports de pouvoir, les valeurs, les institutions, les structures et les systèmes de croyance à l'origine des crises actuelles.
C'est l'histoire, et non la science seule, qui est plus à même de fournir l'imagination politique nécessaire pour répondre à la question cruciale :
comment agir ?
Ce cours propose une analyse critique des différentes hypothèses sur les origines humaines du changement climatique et de la dégradation de la planète, en les croisant avec l'histoire de la technologie, du développement et de la mondialisation.
Nous explorerons les débats sur les débuts de l'Anthropocène et ses moteurs historiques, ainsi que les critiques du concept, avant d'examiner son intégration dans les relations internationale, les sciences et la culture populaire contemporaines.
Ce cours suppose une charge de lecture et vise à offrir un cadre pour comprendre et évaluer les enjeux des politiques environnementales mondiales.
Ainsi les participant·e·s analyseront comment ces diverses visions du passé influencent l'attribution politique des responsabilités et la définition des objectifs de réduction du changement climatique.
Le cours explore les mythes et les textes fondateurs des cultures antiques (Monde biblique, Grèce, Rome, Egypte).
Explorant leurs significations, leurs réceptions, il s'agit de dérouler une histoire de l'imaginaire qui nous aide à mieux comprendre le caractère hétéroclite de notre propre culture.
Méditerranée antique :
amour, guerre et mort Ce cours permet à l'étudiant-e d'étendre sa connaissance des mondes de la Méditerranée antique, sa compréhension des mythes de la Méditerranée ancienne, du travail comparatiste et de la réflexion sur l'altérité et les différences anthropologiques.
Il/elle explorera de grands thèmes anthropologiques (mort, sexualité, violence, civilisation) dans les mythes de la Méditerranée ancienne (Proche-Orient, Bible, Egypte, Grèce, Rome).
Ces thèmes permettront de développer une réflexion comparée sur l'articulation des mythes avec les pratiques culturelles et religieuses des civilisations concernées.
Philosophie de la nature :
Physique et philosophie au XXe siècle.
Le cours traite les questions philosophiques que la physique soulève, en particulier les grandes théories physiques du XXe siècle, à savoir les théories de la relativité d'Einstein et la physique quantique.
Philosophie de la nature :
Physique et philosophie au XXe siècle Le cours se centre sur les grandes théories physiques du XXe siècle, à savoir les théories de la relativité d'Einstein et la physique quantique.
On s'intéressera au bouleversement des notions traditionnelles d'espace et de temps qu'introduit la théorie de la relativité restreinte, au rapport entre espace, temps et matière que propose la théorie de la relativité générale et, en particulier, aux problèmes de compréhension de la physique quantique.
Le cours se base sur le livre Philosophie des sciences.

Cet enseignement abordera la formation, la modification et le maintien des comportements comportements individuels et collectifs pro-environnementaux, tels qu'étudiés par la psychologie sociale de l'environnement.
Nous étudierons en particulier le rôle de la coopération.
La coopération dans la psychologie sociale de l'environnement Objectifs généraux de l'enseignement Quelles sont les motivations qui amènent les individus et les groupes à des comportements pro-environnementaux ?
Quelles sont les barrières qui entravent ces comportements ?
Quels sont les processus collectifs qui peuvent aider à dépasser les barrières individuelles ?
Ces quelques questions seront abordées tout au long de cet enseignement, qui a pour but d'explorer les prédicteurs et les mécanismes sous-jacents aux comportements pro-environnementaux des individus, des groupes, des institutions et des organisations.
Dans le cadre de ce cours, l'accent sera mis sur les facteurs sociaux, et en particulier la coopération.
Nous traiterons ces questions en nous basant sur de nombreuses théories et de nombreux travaux empiriques menés dans le champ de la psychologie sociale qui se sont penchés sur des questions liées à l'environnement.
Les étudiant.e.s seront également amené.e.s à participer de façon constructive durant les cours et dans la cadre de discussions lors des travaux de groupe.
Plan du cours Durant le semestre, nous aborderons plusieurs concepts théoriques de psychologie sociale, qui seront illustrés par de nombreuses recherches antérieures.
Afin de sensibiliser les étudiant.e.s à la démarche scientifique, chacun.e présentera (en groupe ou en individuel selon l'effectif du cours) un article scientifique de psychologie sociale lié à la thématique, ceci afin d'amener la classe à approfondir les thèmes abordés en cours, mais aussi d'illustrer comment se déroule une recherche scientifique.
Cet enseignement a pour but de revenir sur les conflits entre sciences et religions.
Des conflits inévitables quand la science décida d'aborder des thèmes qui recouvrent ceux discutés dans les textes sacrés, en particulier la question de l'origine du monde ou du vivant.
Dans cet enseignement nous reviendrons sur certaines tentatives concordistes actuelles qui ont essayé de faire dialoguer sciences et religions, en particulier autour de la question de l'origine de la terre et de l'origine du vivant.
En proposant un retour critique (historique et épistémologique) sur certains épisodes importants de l'histoire des sciences modernes (l'affaire Galilée, Darwin et l'origine des espèces, la querelles sur l'existence des dinosaures, les principes du Big Bang), il s'agira de présenter aux étudiants plusieurs outils qui leur permettront de mieux se situer par rapport à l'idée d'un possible dialogue entre le domaine du religieux et celui des sciences.
Ce cours-séminaire donne aux participant.e.s la possibilité de comprendre comment la profession a évolué et de réfléchir à leur futur métier d'ingénieur-manager dans un contexte de profondes mutations.

Ce cours propose de concevoir un jeu vidéo avec Unity dont la marche constitue le cœur de l'expérience.
En s'appuyant sur des références, des prototypes et la narration environnementale, les étudiant·es imaginent un parcours immersif où chaque pas active des éléments du récit.
Ce cours vous propose une exploration pratique et critique du format walking simulator, un genre vidéoludique fondé sur l'exploration, l'immersion spatiale et la narration environnementale.
L'objectif sera de concevoir un jeu vidéo avec le logiciel Unity dans laquelle la marche devient le moteur principal du récit.
À travers une série d'étapes guidées, vous découvrirez comment l'espace, le rythme, le son, l'environnement et les objets peuvent être agencés pour produire une narration implicite, progressive et poétique.
Vous commencerez par étudier des références clés du genre (Dear Esther, Firewatch, Journey, The Graveyard, etc.) et apprendrez à analyser leur langage formel et narratif.
Une méthode de création basée sur des cartes thématiques et des contraintes de design vous aidera à imaginer une histoire fragmentée, révélée au fur et à mesure de l'exploration.
Vous prototyperez d'abord votre concept avec des outils simples (storyboard, cartes, prototypes papier), avant de passer à Unity où vous modéliserez une scène interactive en 3D à partir d'un template que vous pourrez adapter à votre concept.
La marche dans cet espace déclenchera des événements, modulations sonores, textes ou transformations visuelles qui porteront la narration.
L'expérience finale sera un jeu vidéo conçue comme une micro-marche narrative où chaque pas révèlera votre narration.
Le cours mettra l'accent sur la cohérence entre interaction minimale et récit.
Le cours examine l'évolution des pays d'Asie orientale durant la période de la Guerre froide:
la victoire du parti communiste en Chine, la reconstruction et la seconde modernisation du Japon ainsi que les guerres de Corée et, si le temps le permet, du Vietnam.
L'Asie orientale durant la Guerre froide La victoire du parti communiste en Chine en 1949 bouleverse la géopolitique régionale.
Elle favorise indirectement la seconde modernisation du Japon après la phase de reconstruction du pays, fournit un appui décisif au processus de décolonisation du Vietnam durant la guerre d'Indochine et constitue un facteur déclencheur de la guerre de Corée.
Le cours considérera successivement le cas de la Chine (de la mise en place des institutions communistes à la Révolution culturelle), du Japon (traumatisme de la défaite, croissance économique et mutations socio-culturelles), de la Corée (guerre et bipartition de la péninsule) et, si le temps le permet, du Vietnam (guerre d'Indochine, bipartition consécutive aux accords de Genève de 1954, guerre du Vietnam et réunification du pays).
L'objectif du cours est de développer une méthodologie d'analyse du jeu vidéo, en particulier via une démarche empirique originale:
le "Let's play".
Il s'agira de présenter la manière dont le jeu vidéo peut être utilisé pour éclairer des savoirs et, en retour, d'être éclairé par eux.
Nous entendons souvent l'expression "culture geek" et, malheureusement, cette dernière semble être la plupart du temps utilisée de manière péjorative.
Or, le jeu vidéo n'est plus une affaire de geeks:
domaine de l'industrie culturelle le plus en vogue aujourd'hui, il propose une multiplicité d'expériences différentes et s'appuie sur un savoir-faire se développant jour après jour.
Plus précisément, nous travaillerons dans ce cours à partir de plusieurs concepts propres aux théories de la fiction et verrons comment les jeux vidéo s'inscrivent dans ce domaine, mais aussi le type d'expériences spécifiques qu'ils permettent de vivre.
Le cours sera structuré entre des enseignements théoriques (découverte de textes critiques sur la notion de fiction, élaboration d'outils d'analyse) et un travail de recherche en groupe, orienté vers une forme pédagogique d'utilisation du jeu vidéo :
le "Let's play".
Le cours vise à faire découvrir les bases du design graphique, ses enjeux, ses différents domaines d'application, ses techniques et ses conventions.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique qui repose sur le développement d'un projet de semestre.
Mise en page et narration Sur la base d'une thématique donnée, le projet consistera à créer un contenu graphique et à le présenter avec une mise en page appropriée.
Le cours propose d'expérimenter les spécificités du design industriel en confrontant les étudiant.e.s à la création d'un objet.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique qui repose sur le développement d'un projet de semestre.
Le projet consiste à expérimenter les spécificités du design industriel pour concevoir un objet original.
Cela peut-être un objet lié au besoin du quotidien, un outil de travail spécifique, un ustensile pratique, un luminaire, un petit meuble ou simplement un développement d'un nouveau processus ou encore un travail de recherche sur un matériau.
Le thème précis sera donné durant le cours d'introduction.
Commençant par une phase de recherche sous forme d'une série d'images de références et d'esquisses, la première partie du semestre sera consacrée à trouver un concept personnel et original.
La deuxième partie du semestre sera consacrée au développement de l'idée choisie sous forme de diverses maquettes et tests.
La phase finale du projet sera dédiée à la mise au point des détails constructifs et à la réalisation d'une maquette grandeur nature.

Ce cours se penche sur les réalités et les pratiques du travail d'ingénieur·e quant à leurs rôles, travail et savoirs, ainsi que leurs évolutions, relations par rapport à d'autres métiers et dans la société.
Réalités et pratiques du travail d'ingénieur La réalité du métier d'ingénieur·e est loin de l'image qui en est donnée dans les cours et dans les médias.
Nombreux·euses sont les ingénieur·e·s qui, arrivé·e·s dans l'emploi, se sentent frustré·e·s et découvrent une réalité bien éloignée de la vision idéalisée véhiculées au cours de la formation.
Au cours de leur formation, certain·e·s étudiant·e·s s'interrogent.
Passionné·e·s de sciences et de techniques, iels pressentent que leur travail ne sera pas celui de chercheur·euse qui transpire de la part des enseignant·e·s les plus brillant·e·s.
Alors qu'en est-il ?
L'enseignement se penchera sur :
les origines et les évolutions historiques de la profession;
les trajectoires de quelques ingénieur·e·s ordinaires;
les tâches et les pratiques de l'ingénieur·e;
ethnographie de l'activité de conception et d'innovation;
les savoirs de l'ingénieur·e et la question de l'incertitude;
la confrontation au management et au management de projet;
les rôles sociaux de l'ingénieur·e·s et la socialisation professionnelle;
la légitimité des chef·fe·s de projet;
dimension politique et identitaire dans les projets;
ingénierie et militantisme;
événements inattendus, alertes, normalisation des dérives et silence organisationnel;
l'éthique de l'ingénieur·e;
la mondialisation;
le statut social.
Le cours explore, sous la forme de projets de groupes, les textes fondateurs des cultures antiques (Proche-Orient ancien, Grèce, Rome, Egypte).
En fin de semestre, les groupes présentent leur oeuvre de manière ludique et pédagogique.
Projets de groupes:
oeuvres majeures des mythologies mediterraneennes Constitution de groupes (de 4 a 6) travaillant sur une oeuvre majeure (epopee, poesie, theatre, histoire, philsophie...).
Le choix s'effectue parmi une liste donnee par les enseignants, mais qui reste ouverte aux propositions des etudiant-es.
L'enjeu de ce travail est de restituer le contexte et le contenu de cette oeuvre a travers un media original :
cinema, animation, theatre, jeux video, bande dessinee, etc.
Deroulement du semestre:
- Formation des groupes - Suivi de l'avancee de la lecture et de l'elaboration du projet a l'occasion de rencontres personnalisees avec chaque groupe.
- Presentation du projet
Une introduction à l'histoire de la pensée économique qui invite à réfléchir à un débat actuel - la planification de la transition écologique - à travers le débat historique sur le calcul socialiste, qui opposa partisans du marché autorégulé et partisans de la planification.
Du calcul socialiste à la planification digitale Ce cours d'histoire de la pensée économique invite à considérer les débats actuels sur la planification écologique (Durand & Keucheyan, 2024) à l'aune d'un double retour:
théorique, à travers le débat sur le calcul socialiste qui a opposé économistes libéraux et économistes socialistes (Boettke, 2000), et historique, à travers les expériences de planification qui ont eu lieu dans l'histoire du 20e siècle (Sapir, 2022;
Nove, 1983).
Nous reviendrons ensuite vers le présent, en considérant les expériences de pensée (Cockshott & Cottrell, 1993) ou dans l'histoire (Morozov, 2024) de reconsidérer toute la question de la planification économique au vu des avancées de la science informatique :
après tout, une planification est-elle possible?
Cet enseignement de Psychologie Sociale traite des processus sociocognitifs impliqués dans le jugement social et la formation d'impression.
Objectif et Descriptif général :
Juger autrui est une activité essentielle de la vie quotidienne.
Mais les recherches en psychologie sociale ont mis en évidence que le jugement social, bien qu'a priori intuitif, repose sur des mécanismes variés qui peuvent mobiliser des informations issues d'une multitude de sources.
L'objectif de ce cours est d'étudier les principaux travaux issus de la psychologie sociale ayant étudié les processus sociocognitifs à la base du jugement social et de la formation d'impression.
Plan du cours :
Durant le semestre, nous présenterons plusieurs concepts théoriques, qui seront illustrés par de nombreuses recherches empiriques :
Inférence dispositionnelle, amorçage et accessibilité, processus automatiques et contrôlés, heuristiques de jugement, imprégnation culturelle.
Afin de sensibiliser les étudiant-e-s à la démarche scientifique, chacun-e présentera (en groupe) un projet de recherche en psychologie sociale - ceci afin d'amener la classe à approfondir les thèmes abordés en cours, mais aussi d'illustrer comment se déroule une recherche scientifique.
Faire ou faire faire ?
Est-ce que l'Etat doit offrir lui-même les prestations données au public ou doit-il mandater des tiers pour ce faire ?
Ce cours vise à présenter et à analyser la manière dont l'État intervient dans la fourniture de services publics (électricité, culture, éducation, etc.).
Pourquoi les prix de l'électricité fluctuent fortement alors que la plupart des acteurs qui produisent et/ou distribuent cette forme d'énergie sont des entreprises détenues par des collectivités publiques ?
A titre d'exemple, Axpo possède 100 sites de production d'électricité en Suisse (pour l'essentiel des barrages) et exploite la centrale nucléaire de Beznau.
L'entreprise est propriété des cantons et villes de la Suisse du Nord-Ouest (Zürich et Argovie).
La loi sur le CO2 de 2011 prévoyait la possibilité d'un prélèvement sur les carburants fossiles émetteurs de gaz à effet de serre (« centime climatique ») dans le but de compenser les émissions.
Comment est-il possible que la fondation qui récupérait les montants prélevés était gérée par les groupes pétroliers ?
Comment comprendre le fait que les rentes versées en cas de chômage le sont par des organisations publiques et privées et que les chômeurs ont le libre choix de leur caisse ?
Ces quelques exemples montrent que l'État intervient de manière très diverse pour réguler les tâches publiques comme les marchés privés.
Il peut intervenir en créant ses propres structures (administration) pour délivrer des prestations publiques (écoles par exemple), en créant des structures rendues autonomes par la loi (universités, EPF, etc.), en ayant des participations dans des sociétés (Swisscom, RUAG, etc.) ou encore en imposant des règles à des organisations privées qui proposent des tâches publiques ou privées.
Le but du cours est de comprendre les possibilités qu'a l'État d'intervenir avec ses propres structures (logiques managériales) et/ou en régulant l'activité des autres acteurs (régulation).
Il va s'appuyer sur de nombreux exemples et, en fonction de leur disponibilité, de présentations d'acteurs du secteur public.
Les participants choisiront un domaine de prestations publiques (électricité, prestations médicales, gestion des compensations carbone, etc.), identifieront les principaux acteurs publics et privés, les règles de fonctionnement des marchés et les comportements possibles de ces acteurs.
Ces analyses s'effectueront dans le cadre de travaux de groupe.

Descriptif général de la matière enseignée Le cours comprend une partie générale et une partie spéciale.
Dans la partie générale, le cours introduit les notions permettant de saisir les finalités, l'organisation et le fonctionnement du système de protection des biens immatériels.
Dans la partie spéciale, le cours approfondit les principaux droits de propriété intellectuelle qui composent ce système (droit d'auteur, brevets d'invention, marques), à travers la présentation des lois qui les consacrent.
L'accent est mis sur le droit suisse, avec indication des instruments internationaux applicables en Suisse.
Plan du cours (aperçu) présentation du cours (objectifs, organisation, évaluations) - conférence introductive (partie générale) - droit d'auteur - droit des brevets d'invention - droit des marques (partie spéciale).
Les étudiant·e·s analysent la façon dont sciences, technologies et sociétés sont coproduites, en se penchant sur leur représentation dans des bandes dessinées.
La bande dessinée est un média qui donne une représentation (réaliste, fictive, vulgarisée ou critique) des sciences et des technologies, en train de se faire, établies ou en usage dans la société.
Le cours explore différentes de ces représentations afin de les examiner de manière critique et de se préparer à enquêter sur la réalité des sciences et des technologies, en train de se faire et en usage dans la société.
Introduction générale sur l'étude sociale des sciences et des technologies.

Décrire les processus cognitifs et cérébraux à l'œuvre dans les processus de mémoire et la formation de l'individualité.
Identifier les différences et les similitudes entre approches neurobiologiques et cliniques.
Connaître les concepts de base de la psychanalyse et leurs implications scientifiques Ce cours se propose de traiter les différents aspects de la mémoire en reliant les données comportementales aux corrélats cérébraux associés et en abordant la question de comment ces données donnent un nouvel éclairage à des théories comme la psychanalyse.
Une partie du cours sera consacrée à la présentation des mécanismes cérébraux et cognitifs au sujet de la mémoire et la constitution d'une vie intérieure subjective.
Qu'est-ce que la mémoire ?
Pourquoi peut-on parler de mémoires au pluriel ?
Quels sont les facteurs impliqués dans la consolidation d'un souvenir ?
Comment la trace de nos souvenirs est-elle inscrite dans le cerveau ?
Comment notre subjectivité et notre individualité se forment-t-elles au travers de l'organisation de nos souvenirs ?
Comment émerge cette réalité intérieure inconsciente?
Quelles sont les méthodes expérimentales qui permettent de rendre compte de l'existence d'une telle vie fantasmatique ?
Pourquoi les souvenirs traumatiques sont-ils si sensibles aux indices de rappel ?
Est-il possible d'étudier expérimentalement des hypothèses psychanalytiques comme le refoulement de souvenirs traumatiques ?
Peut-on apprendre sans en être conscient et quelle influence cela peut-il avoir sur notre comportement?
Quelles sont les différences et les similitudes entre l'inconscient cognitif et l'inconscient freudien ?
Comment les données actuelles en neurosciences donnent-elles un nouvel éclairage sur les processus mis en œuvre lors de la réactivation de souvenirs lors de la psychothérapie ?
La réflexion des étudiants sera encouragée sur ces questions tout en introduisant aux bases de l'étude de la mémoire et du psychisme.
Ce cours revient sur l'histoire des opposants à Darwin et au darwinisme :
créationnistes, néo-créationnistes, partisans du dessein intelligent.
Quels sont leurs arguments ?
Quelles sont leurs stratégies ?
Que font-ils de certaines découvertes récentes ?
Dans L'Origine des espèces (1859), le naturaliste anglais Charles Darwin affirme que les êtres vivants sont le produit d'une évolution, d'une série de transformations biologiques au cours de laquelle s'exerce une sélection naturelle.
Cette théorie scientifique malmena immédiatement une certaine représentation religieuse du monde et du vivant, mais reconfigura aussi durablement les rapports entre les sciences et les religions.
Nous reprendrons la longue histoire des opposants à Darwin et au darwinisme, qu'il s'agisse des premiers créationnistes, des néo-créationnistes, des partisans du dessein intelligent...
pour essayer de comprendre leurs stratégies et leurs arguments, mais aussi l'instrumentalisation qu'ils font de la science.
Nous insisterons sur le cas particulier des courants créationnistes et littéralistes qui, après avoir émergé aux USA au début des années 1920, se sont développés en Europe et dans le reste du monde depuis les années 2000.
Le cours sensibilise les étudiant-es à l'importance des marchés émergents dans le paysage mondial de l'innovation.
Il propose des outils de modélisation pour analyser des innovations produits/services dans le contexte des marchés émergents.
Le cours aborde les technologies et l'innovation dans les marchés émergents au travers de cadres analytiques et de thématiques :
Cadres analytiques :
vides institutionnels, modèles d'affaires, proposition de valeur, etc.
Thématiques :
base de la pyramide, innovation frugale, propriété intellectuelle, innovation sociale, etc.
Les parties "cadres analytiques" et "thématiques" feront toutes deux l'objet de 4 sessions.
Les 5 dernières sessions du semestre seront consacrées à un projet sous forme d'ateliers.

Ce cours explore comment les Humanités se transforment à l'ère de l'intelligence artificielle et des données massives.
Chaque séance aborde le futur d'une discipline.
Les étudiants développent un prototype numérique (Vibe coding) pour accelerer la recherche et l'éducation en SHS.
Ce cours propose une exploration critique et prospective des Humanités à l'ère de l'intelligence artificielle, des données massives et des systèmes de simulation.
Il s'adresse à tous les étudiants intéressés par l'évolution des savoirs et des pratiques culturelles à l'horizon 2050.
Le cours s'articule en trois parties.
La première partie pose les fondements :
elle explore la manière dont les modes de production, d'archivage, et d'interprétation sont transformés par les technologies numériques.
Sont abordées les notions de construction collective des savoirs, de capitalisme linguistique et patrimonial, de mediations graces aux modèles de langage, entre autres.
La deuxième partie adopte une approche disciplinaire.
Chaque séance est consacrée au "futur" d'une discipline des humanités (histoire, philosophie, littérature, histoire de l'art, sociologie, etc.) et montre comment les méthodes des Humanités Digitales permettent de renouveler les questions et les outils propres à ces domaines.
Une initiation au "Vibe coding" est intégrée pour permettre aux étudiants de concevoir leur projet, sans qu'aucune connaissance préalable en programmation ne soit requise.
Tout au long du semestre, chaque groupe d'étudiants développe un prototype numérique individuel (réalisé dans un environnement comme Replit) :
un outil simple destiné à aider un historien, un philosophe ou un historien de l'art dans une tâche de recherche.
Une séance intermédiaire est consacrée à la présentation des projets en cours, et la dernière séance à leur restitution finale.
Cet enseignement aborde les grands enjeux des relations internationales de la Suisse aux XIXe et XXe siècles.
Les étudiant·e·s apprendront à analyser de manière critique des documents d'époque (sources) et, sur cette base, à élaborer une réflexion critique sur l'histoire de la Suisse.
L'enseignement "La Suisse dans les relations internationales" a pour objectif de proposer une histoire globale de la Suisse aux XIXe et XXe siècles.
En s'intéressant aux interrelations avec l'histoire de l'Europe et des autres continents, les étudiant·e·s aborderont l'histoire de la Suisse dans toutes ses dimensions (politique, économique, sociale et culturelle).
Il s'agira d'observer la position du pays sur la scène internationale durant cette période marquée par de fortes tensions internationales et de comprendre les particularités de sa politique étrangère :
fort internationalisme, "neutralité", tradition humanitaire, impact des enjeux économiques.
Nous verrons dans quelle mesure les stratégies mises en oeuvre par le gouvernement helvétique au niveau diplomatique ont des retombées sur la construction d'une certaine image du pays, une forme de Nation Branding, qui perdure encore aujourd'hui.
A partir de l'analyse critique de documents d'époque (sources), les étudiant·e·s apprendront à déconstruire l'histoire suisse traditionnelle et seront amené·e·s à conduire une réflexion plus large sur la question du rapport entre histoire et identité nationale.
Cette démarche leur permettra de se familiariser avec les outils et méthodes de la recherche en histoire.
L'approche globale mobilisée dans ce cours vise à démontrer l'interdépendance de la Suisse avec le contexte international, les effets des enjeux internationaux sur la politique helvétique et, plus largement, à réintégrer dans les rapports de force le rôle des petits Etats (à la "périphérie du pouvoir") souvent négligés ou restants en marge dans la production historiographique dominante.
Cette perspective permet notamment de remettre en question le paradigme du Sonderfall (cas particulier) helvétique qui est resté pendant longtemps un impensé.
Inversement, arrimer l'histoire globale à un terrain concret et bien délimité à l'image du cas suisse permettra d'éclairer la façon dont des processus internationaux (phénomènes migratoires, transferts culturels) et des doctrines (colonialisme, impérialisme, internationalisme, pacifisme, multilatéralisme) impactent la politique suisse selon des modalités spécifiques.
Cette articulation entre histoire nationale et histoire globale guidera nos réflexions.
Le cours réunit des étudiants de l'EPFL et de l'UNIL et tire parti de l'interdisciplinarité, de la créativité et du design participatif pour imaginer de nouveaux modes de vie, de travail et de cohabitation à travers la création d'un prototype d'objet, de service ou d'expérience.
Basé sur une approche de projet et de human-centered design, ce cours propose de questionner en équipe interdisciplinaires nos modes de vie, de travail et de cohabitation afin d'explorer de nouvelles opportunités d'innovation, puis de les tester en context réel grâce à un ou plusieurs prototypes.
Le cours aborde notamment les questions suivantes:
Comment structurer une approche créative de la résolution de problème?
Comment approcher un nouveau problème?
Quelle approche pour le résoudre?
Pourquoi et comment intégrer les utilisateurs dans les phases initiales d'un projet?
Comment tester rapidement une idée?
Comment travailler en équipe interdisciplinaire?
Ce cours insiste sur la nécessité d'intégrer les différents acteurs d'un projet (utilisateurs finaux, experts, partenaires, institutions) dans sa phase de développement afin d'augmenter ses chances de réussite.
Chaque session est précédée d'une vidéo d'introduction théorique puis est composée d'activités de groupe et de travail en atelier.

Présentation du projet final
Cet enseignement aborde les approches conceptuelles de l'anthropologie urbaine, ainsi que les méthodes et les expériences de terrain.
En 2025-2026, il participe au projet 'A Future for Whose Past?' consacré aux patrimoines matériels et immatériels des communautés minorisées, initié par l'ETHZ.
L'Année européenne de l'architecture fête en 2025 son jubilé de 50 ans.
À cette occasion, le cours Anthropologie de l'urbain réoriente exceptionnellement son enseignement pour participer à un projet de recensement des lieux patrimoniaux dans toute la Suisse, intitulé 'A Future for Whose Past?
The Heritage of Minorities, Fringe Groups and People without a Lobby Heritage Year 2025', réalisé en collaboration avec l'Office Fédéral de la Culture et l'ICOMOS Suisse.
Il s'inscrit également dans la continuité du cours 'FutureHeritage' dispensé en 2023-2024 à l'ETHZ par la Professeure Silke Langenberg.
'FutureHeritage' vise à interroger la conservation du patrimoine des bâtiments historiques, déjà inscrits dans l'inventaire au niveau fédéral, cantonal et communal, ainsi que ceux des futurs objets qui pourraient être identifiés, sélectionnés et protégés en Suisse.
Les travaux des étudiant·es intègreront une base de données comprenant déjà ceux de l'ETHZ dont la plateforme sera publiquement accessible en 2026.
Enfin, le cours vise également à mettre en valeur les travaux des étudiant·es, notamment à travers leur participation aux Journées européennes du patrimoine (JEP).
Le cours introduit aux bases théoriques de la conservation du patrimoine, afin de mieux en comprendre les principes et la mise en pratique.
Une série de conférences avec des intervenant.es invité.es et d'exercices pratiques sur le terrain seront organisés lors des sessions de cours.
Les étudiant.es choisiront librement un objet du patrimoine matériel ou immatériel des communautés minorisées, principalement à Lausanne ou en Suisse romande.
Iels travailleront d'abord en groupe, puis individuellement.
Le but de ce travail est d'identifier les bâtiments marginaux, moins connus, voire inattendus, associés aux divers groupes et communautés vivant en Suisse, et de proposer des approches innovantes en matière de préservation.
Une table ronde finale sera dédiée à la présentation des résultats de leur recherche empirique, sous forme de fiches d'inventaire illustrées, qui enrichiront la base de données 'Future Heritage'.
Il n'est pas nécessaire d'avoir des compétences architecturales pour cet enseignement.
Il est ouvert à toute personne qui s'intéresse aux liens complexes entre les groupes sociaux minoritaires et leur patrimoine en Suisse.
Ce cours propose d'acquérir des compétences en création de jeux vidéo, en invitant les étudiant·e·s à mettre leurs connaissances au service d'un projet collectif de recherche-création centré sur la ludification (gamification) d'un contenu scientifique.
Ce cours propose d'envisager le jeu vidéo en tant qu'objet de recherche à partir des travaux menés en sciences humaines et sociales dans le domaine des sciences du jeu (game studies).
Au fil des séances, les étudiant·e·s auront l'occasion d'acquérir des connaissances en création de jeux vidéo et de se familiariser avec diverses recherches en médiation culturelle et scientifique avec le jeu.
Le jeu vidéo nous amène à développer une "relation intuitive à l'algorithme" (Wark 2007:
30) que le joueur ou la joueuse déploie au fil du jeu, au gré de son contact avec l'espace fictionnel, réglé par les calculs de la machine informatique.
Cette réflexion nous permettra de questionner le potentiel pédagogique du jeu vidéo et d'en faire l'expérience à travers la réalisation d'un prototype jouable.
Ce cours "orienté projet" amènera les étudiant·e·s à travailler en groupe autour d'un projet de gamification à partir d'un matériau scientifique venant de leur discipline.
Du temps sera alloué pour le travail en groupe lors de la majorité des séances.
L'évaluation portera sur la rédaction d'un rapport décrivant la création du jeu vidéo et revenant sur les choix de design effectués.
Les notions fondamentales de l'étude du jeu vidéo seront ainsi exploitées dans la réalisation d'un projet concret de game design.
Ce cours constitue une introduction à la question des théories complotistes en particulier dans le champ des sciences.
Dans cet enseignement, nous essaierons de comprendre comment les « complotistes » en arrivent à douter de tout sauf de leur propre croyance et se fourvoient bien souvent dans les labyrinthes des biais de raisonnement.
Comme nous le verrons avec l'aide de plusieurs exemples, en particulier des théories complotistes portant sur la science, nous ne sommes pas des êtres parfaitement rationnels (soucoupismes, anciens astronautes, terre-platistes, climatoscepticismes, épidémies, vaccin).
La médecine personnalisée, préventive, prédictive et participative bouleverse les connaissances médicales établies, ainsi que les configurations sociales et politiques de la médecine.
Ce cours analyse ces processus à travers une approche interdisciplinaire issue des Science and Technology Studies.
Les étudiant.e.s disposeront des ressources conceptuelles, empiriques et analytiques nécessaires pour comprendre la médecine 4P en tant que phénomène social et politique ainsi que technique et scientifique.
Pour ce faire, le cours se compose de :
Un cours d'introduction présentant des perspectives historiques, philosophiques et sociologiques analysant la Médecine dite des 4P;
le cours introduit une approche analytique aux thématiques abordées fondée sur les Science and Technology Studies (STS) ;
Plusieurs interventions conjointes de spécialistes des sciences humaines/sociales et d'experts biomédicaux sur des axes thématiques partagés (par exemple, les thérapies anticancéreuses de précision, la génomicisation des risques de santé individuels, les big data et l'épidémiologie digitale, l'épigénétique et les modulateurs biosociaux de la maladie, les technologies numériques en santé, etc.) ;
Plusieurs créneaux au long du semestre spécifiquement dédiés au coaching, à la planification, la coordination et la finalisation des projets de poster intégrant la perspective analytique du cours.
À noter que le cours est ouvert également aux étudiant.e.s UNIL, ce qui permet de reproduire la perspective interdisciplinaire des interventions dans les projets de semestre.
Une Student Conference à la fin du cours qui consiste en la présentation des projets de poster des étudiant.e.s.
Les projets des étudiant.e.s seront caractérisés par la même approche anayltique que celle explorée par les interventions conjointes du cours.
L'interdisciplinarité est encouragée par la participation conjointe d'étudiant.e.s de toute filière EPFL et de plusieurs curricula de sciences humaines et sociales de l'UNIL.
La langue officielle du cours est le français, mais le cours est de facto bilingue.
Les contenus étudiés étant très souvent en anglais et certains invité pouvant être non-francophone, l'anglais y occupe une place importante.
Les étudiants anglophones sont donc les bienvenus.
The official language of the course is French, but the course is de facto bilingual.
Some of the topics explored are in English, much like several of the speakers are English-speaking.
English is thus central to the course and english-speaking students are welcome.
Ce cours propose de partir des paradigmes de la durabilité et d'en décliner les conséquences sociales et politiques contemporaines.
Nous allons adopter une approche critique des diverses théorisations, nous saisirons les acteurs qui en font la promotion et étudierons les mobilisations sociales.
Le paradigme de durabilité prend des visages et se déploie selon une variété de méthodes et d’approches, plus ou moins critiques et radicales, qui composent quelque chose comme des « cultures » et « modes de vie de la durabilité ».
Ces cultures et modes de vie questionnent et mettent à l’épreuve conjointement l’économie et l’environnement.
Ainsi, un gros éventail de thèmes sont en lien avec le principe de durabilité comme l’économie verte, l’énergie renouvelable, l’alimentation bio, la préservation de la biodiversité, les changements des comportements de mobilité, la croissance soutenable, la décroissance, la transition écologique, le « Green New Deal », le « Green washing », et cetera… Toutefois, au-delà de l’imbrication de la dimension économique et environnementale, qu’en est-il de la dimension sociale ?
Il s’agira dans ce cours d’étudier les diverses compréhensions de la durabilité mobilisées par ces approches pour ensuite en analyser les conséquences sociales et politiques, lorsqu’elles sont mises en œuvre et si elles sont mises en œuvre.
Interroger la perspective de la durabilité d’un point de vue sociologique nous permettra d’examiner les interactions entre la sphère économique, la sphère écologique et la sphère sociale.
Ces interactions mobilisent des concepts forts comme responsabilité, équité, éthique et capacités, et il s’agira dans ce cours d’en saisir les conséquences.
Nous verrons que les politiques de la durabilité peuvent engendrer des conséquences sociales indésirables telles que l’exclusion, le renforcement des inégalités dans le marché du travail, la fragilisation des identités et l’augmentation des vulnérabilités de certaines minorités sociales.
Pour suivre les déclinaisons de la durabilité, ce cours proposera un volet empirique visant à analyser une multitude d’actions et de pratiques, des démarches publicitaires de « Green Washing » jusqu’aux mobilisations écologiques les plus récentes (Grève du climat, slow food, etc.).
L'enseignement propose une introduction à l'histoire de l'art contemporain du XIXe au XXIe siècles, permettant d'aborder les oeuvres selon une approche esthétique et sociale L'histoire de l'art repose sur la valorisation de créations visuelles, dont la thématique et les moyens formels évoluent fortement entre le XIXe et le XXIe siècle, reflétant les changements des codes esthétiques, des techniques, des intérêts, du rôle de l'art et de l'artiste dans la société mais également ceux du goût d'un public.
Ce goût est modelé par les interactions entre les espaces d'exposition, les institutions muséales, le marché de l'art, des alliances électives et les médias.
S'il veut voir son oeuvre reconnu, l'artiste moderne doit établir une stratégie jouant sur l'un ou l'autre de ces leviers, et, si possible, sur plusieurs d'entre eux.
De la tactique tous azimuts de Gustave Courbet au milieu du XIXe siècle à la saturation numérique des créateurs du net art, différentes stratégies se dessinent selon les époques, les lieux, les personnalités et les ressources à disposition, alors que l'opportunisme est souvent la clef du succès.
Cet enseignement vise à retracer les liens entre les créateurs, leur oeuvre et un public, qui répond à une structure plurielle.
This course explores and practices some of the fundamental tools of designing for sustainability with a focus on the sustainability, desirability, and economic viability of solutions.
Design for Sustainability takes the participants through practical concepts, tools and processes to propose design solutions that aim to improve the co-existence of humans, preserve biodiversity, and life-supporting systems.
It integrates environmental, economic, social and cultural dimensions.
The course explores approaches at different levels (material, product, product-service system, social innovation, and system transformation).
It covers the framing, ideation and prototyping phases of designing for sustainability.
Teams will be made up of engineers (EPFL) and industrial designers (ECAL).
Sessions in the fall semester are devoted to discovering and defining a project opportunity through a structured design approach.
During the spring semester, sessions are devoted to the prototyping of a solution through a project-based approach.
There will be two workshops (one in fall, one in spring) aimed at strengthening professional competences (interdisciplinary and team work, etc.).
This course explores and practices some of the fundamental tools of designing for sustainability with a focus on the sustainability, desirability, and economic viability of solutions.
See the full description in the autumn semester course - HUM-397:
Design for sustainability I.
During the spring semester, sessions are devoted to the prototyping of a solution through a project-based approach.
Lecturers provide guidance on semester projects on a regular basis.
Teams will be made up of engineers (EPFL) and industrial designers (ECAL).
There will be two workshops (one in fall, one in spring) aimed at strengthening professional competences (interdisciplinary and team work, etc.).
Ce cours, propose 2 options, en anglais et en français :
'Elsewhere Encounters' propose d'explorer différentes approches d'étude de terrain dans le monde artistique ;
'Réalisation' se penche sur les techniques cinématographiques et s'engage dans la réalisation d'un film court.
Option 1 (in English) :
Elsewhere Encounters:
Field Studies This option addresses different approaches of field studies from within the world of artistic practices.
The first semester combines field experiments at a given location with technical inputs, theoretical lectures and case studies around a chosen theme.
Field work aims at testing different digital and analog tools and technologies such as field notes, drawing, photography, generative tools, field recording, software defined radio, electromagnetic fields capture, and photogrammetry scans in order to gather and exploit data sets as a way towards a personal rereading of these spaces.
Theoretical lectures and case studies aim at contextualizing and discussing students' experiments according to past and present artistic practices and research in a critical perspective.
Over the course of the second semester, students in groups of two design and produce a project based on the skills, methods and knowledge acquired during the first semester and their own tools.
The project is based on the selection of a place and a field of action.
It must fit the semester work topic which is the relation in between the technosphere and nature.
The brief of the project is defined with the lecturers and its conceptual and formal developments are supervised on a weekly basis during tutoring sessions.
Two group presentations are planned.
The mid-term presentation includes a statement, sketches, a scenario and tests made at early stages to ensure the feasibility and potential of their project.
At the end of the semester, a model, a probe or a prototype, a field performance, an installation, a game or a video is presented in order to assess the project outcomes.
The final artifacts are presented for assessment along with a report and illustrations of the process, showing its strengths, weaknesses and the challenges encountered.
Regular attendance is essential for this course.
A part of the grade is dedicated to this.
Option 2 (en français):
Realisation d'un court metrage documentaire.
Les étudiants visionneront des extraits de films et des courts métrages suivi d'une discussion sur la méthodologie/le dispositif des cinéastes étudiés.
A partir de quelques exercices, chaque binôme développera une idée de film centrée sur la notion de "lieu".
Ce projet sera discuté de manière collective afin d'en explorer les intentions, d'en analyser la faisabilité et d'imaginer les outils avec lesquels les étudiants pourraient le mener.
Ainsi, chaque étudiante entraînera sa capacité d'observation, d'écoute et de réaction lors du tournage.
En amont, une transmission des techniques de base aura lieu, assurée par des professionnels du métier.
Les étudiants entraineront en matière de son, d'image et de lumière naturelle pour assurer l'aspect formel du film.
Des séances de visionnement des rushes seront organisées pour munir les équipes de travail de nouveaux outils en fonction de l'expérience en cours.
Tout le matériel nécessaire à la réalisation du court métrage sera fourni en classe.
Une initiation au logiciel Adobe Premiere Pro est prévue ainsi qu'à un accompagnement pendant le processus de montage.
Les films terminés seront projetés en salle, suivis d'une discussion et défense de chaque projet, en présence d'un jury externe.
Pour l'évaluation, la qualité des courts métrages sera prise en compte ainsi que le processus par lequel les étudiants seront passés pendant la création de ce dernier.

The media frequently report on trendy studies in experimental cognitive psychology, and which inform the public on human functioning and its causes.
We teach students basic skills and requirements when performing, understanding and comprehending such studies, through the angle of replication crisis Performing a replication of an empirical study in cognitive psychology Cognitive psychology covers all aspect of our mental world, whether it is perception, attention, memory, language, mental imagery, emotion, concept formation, problem solving, creativity, decision making, reasoning, etc.
To assess cognitive functioning, psychologists working in this field have traditionally applied experimental scientific methods.
In this annual course, in a group of maximum six students, you will set-up a replication of an existing recent empirical experiment.
In the first weeks of term, you will learn about the general concepts behind the empirical replication, get divided into groups, and then, together with a project supervisor, choose a specific empirical study you wish to replicate.
Throughout the two semesters, the team has to analyse and synthesize the recent published scientific literature, choose and formulate their study question, adapt and be able to apply the method for the experiment, collect data from human participants, analyse and interpret their data in comparison to the original study.
After having read the relevant literature, the team will decided on an empirical study to be replicated (autumn term), refine their method (autumn term), orally present the intended study (autumn term), collect data from participants (spring term), statistically analyse and interpret the data (spring term), and orally present the obtained results (spring term).
Their work is evaluated by two written assessements - introduction and method of the scientific report (autumn term) and final complete scientific report (spring term).
L'objectif du cours est que les étudiants acquièrent les bases théoriques et méthodologiques d'une approche sociologique des médias (particulièrement des médias sportifs) et qu'ils puissent s'en servir pour penser de façon critique la culture médiatique et ses effets.
L'enseignement vise l'acquisition de contenus théoriques (présentation de divers travaux sur les médias, modèles et concepts) et de compétences méthodologiques (méthodes pour récolter, traiter et analyser des contenus médiatiques) de sorte que les étudiants apprennent à décoder les informations et à agir sur ce qu'ils lisent, écoutent ou regardent.
Une place importante sera donnée aux médias sportifs de façon à pouvoir engager une réflexion critique sur la mise en spectacle du sport dans les médias.
L'enseignement s'organise autour de trois domaines d'analyse:
premièrement la production des informations sera analysée selon une dimension socio-historique (histoire des médias et des liens entre les médias et les sports notamment), socio-économique (économie des médias et organisation du marché des retransmissions sportives) et socioprofessionnelle (les métiers des médias).
Deuxièmement :
le contenu des informations sportives où une place importante sera accordée à l'analyse de discours journalistiques et l'étude sémiologique d'images sur le sport.
Il s'agira de saisir la façon dont opère le « filtre médiatique », les singularités de l'écriture journalistique (sur le sport) et d'être attentifs aux stéréotypes présents dans les contenus journalistiques.
Enfin, le cours vise à appréhender la réception des médias par le public (consommations médiatiques, conditions sociales et culturelles de réception des messages médiatiques, intelligence critique du public, etc.) pour comprendre quels effets ces derniers peuvent avoir sur l'espace public et les imaginaires partagés.
DEROULEMENT Semestre d'automne Le semestre d'automne est consacré à des séances de cours où seront abordés divers éléments théoriques.
Une place importante sera donnée à des exemples pratiques (analyse de vidéos, de textes et d'images médiatiques).
Ce semestre a également pour objectif de permettre à chaque étudiant d'élaborer une problématique et un projet d'analyse médiatique (individuel ou collectif).
Semestre de printemps Le semestre de printemps est entièrement consacré à la conduite de ce projet et à la rédaction d'un rapport de recherche.
Seront organisées des séances d'encadrement, de présentations orales et de discussion des projets.
L'objectif du cours est que les étudiants acquièrent les bases théoriques et méthodologiques d'une approche sociologique des médias (particulièrement des médias sportifs) et qu'ils puissent s'en servir pour penser de façon critique la culture médiatique et ses effets.

Ce cours propose d'étudier la présence de particularités musicales exotiques (populaires et folkloriques) - en Europe et au-delà - dans la musique classique (XVIIe-XXe siècles).
Il débouche sur la rédaction d'un travail de recherche en groupe (ou individuel) sur un sujet lié à cette thématique.
L'exotisme en musique L'Exotisme - miroitant la musique populaire, le folklore, l'Orient entre autres - résonne dans les milieux artistiques comme une référence identitaire ou un ailleurs, une terre lointaine animée de fantasmes sculptant la pensée.
Depuis la Renaissance, les voyages, les échanges commerciaux et croisades n'ont cessé de nourrir l'imagination des artistes - compositeurs, peintres, sculpteurs, écrivains, etc.
- multipliant les références aux mondes grec, turc, perse, arabe, chinois, japonais, espagnol entre autres.
Des turqueries musicales du XVIIe siècle au jazz afro-américain du début du XXe siècle, les marqueurs des cultures populaires et extra-européennes retentissent dans le répertoire musical savant.
Les représentations sonores de ces traditions musicales autant voisines que lointaines figurent par exemple dans des chansons, des ballets, des opéras, des symphonies, etc.
de compositeurs européens comme Mozart, Saint-Saëns, Debussy ou encore Puccini pour n'en citer que quelques-uns.
A l'inverse, la musique savante est parfois à l'origine de grands standards de Jazz à l'image de Summertime, berceuse extraite de l'opéra «Porgy and Bess» composé en 1935 par George Gershwin.
Cette thématique offre également la possibilité d'aller explorer en exclusivité les archives du Montreux Jazz Festival créé en 1967 par Claude Nobs, René Langel et Géo Voumard.
Dès les premières éditions, chaque concert est enregistré avec des technologies de pointe afin de préserver la mémoire de ces moments éphémères.
Pour assurer la pérennité de ce vaste patrimoine, c'est vers l'EPFL que le Festival se tourne en 2007 afin de mettre sur pied une vaste campagne de digitalisation des archives.
Ce cours a pour objectif de s'interroger sur les origines, les motivations, le langage, et les différentes approches de ces univers exotiques, d'analyser le répertoire musical savant influencé par les musiques populaires et extra-européennes pour aboutir à la rédaction d'un travail en groupe (ou individuel) sur un sujet lié à cette thématique.
1) Le premier semestre s'organise autour de cours :
a) l'Exotisme en musique :
histoire, contextes, enjeux sociaux, oeuvres, genres, études de cas, etc.
b) acquisition des outils de bases (méthodologie, construction d'une bibliographie, définition de la problématique, etc.) nécessaire aux études en sciences humaines.
Des séances de travaux pratiques en classe, en bibliothèque sont prévues afin de définir les sujets de recherches et d'entamer le travail d'analyse et de traitement des sources.
2) Le second semestre est entièrement dédié à la recherche et à la rédaction des travaux autour des sujets définis durant le premier semestre.
De nombreux axes de recherche émergent de cette thématique proposant des approches variées :
historiques, ethnomusicologique, anthropologiques, sociologiques, esthétiques, etc.
Chaque groupe d'étudiant.e.s est libre de proposer une thématique, les sujets sont ensuite discutés et validés par les enseignant.e.s.
Le cours vise à faire découvrir les bases du design graphique, ses enjeux, ses différents domaines d'application, ses techniques et ses conventions.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique qui repose sur le développement d'un projet de semestre.
Design graphique Un thème spécifique sera proposé et développé durant le premier semestre à l'aide d'exercices illustratifs, typographiques et éditoriaux.
Pendant le deuxième semestre, un thème plus général à partir de celui de départ permettra de réaliser un travail plus libre sur un des supports déterminés (journal, affiches, vidéos,...).
Le cours propose d'expérimenter les spécificités du design industriel en confrontant les étudiant.e.s à la création d'un objet.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique dont le résultat est un objet fonctionnel réalisé en collaboration avec un artisan ou une entreprise de l'industrie locale.
Un thème sera donné aux étudiants durant le cours d'introduction.
Commençant par une phase de recherche sous forme d'une série d'images de références, d'esquisses et de tests, la première partie du semestre sera consacrée à trouver des concepts personnels, des approches originales pour créer un objet.
La deuxième partie de semestre sera consacrée au développement de l'idée choisie jusqu'au stade de la maquette de présentation.
Au cours du deuxième semestre, l'idée choisie sera réalisée sous la forme d'un prototype fonctionnel en collaboration avec un fabricant ou une entreprise locale.
Le cours examine de manière ouverte les constructions de la Nature par diverses sciences et cultures.
Il met l'accent sur la pluralité des modes d'apparition de la Nature et sur les rôles qui lui sont prêtés, notamment dans l'opposition avec l'artifice.
La nature et l'artifice:
du paysage à la réalité augmentée Le cours examine de manière ouverte les constructions de la Nature par diverses sciences et cultures.
Il met l'accent sur la pluralité des modes d'apparition de la Nature et sur les rôles qui lui sont prêtés, notamment dans l'opposition avec l'artifice.
Il étudie la Nature:
a) comme objet partagé des sciences et ressource de discours politiques, b) comme sources de créations artistiques, c) comme objet et sujet écologique, d) comme production culturelle dans une perspective anthropologique.
Le plan du cours se divise en deux parties :
la Nature en opposition à l'artifice ;
la Nature au travers de ses objets.
Il est nourri d'alternances entre les approches historiques et théoriques, ainsi que d'exemples concrets donnés par le monde contemporain.
Ce cours présente le cadre légal applicable à certaines problématiques dans des domaines à caractère technique, tels que le droit de la construction, le droit de l'informatique, la biotechnologie, la protection des données, la digitalisation, la robotisation.
Droit des nouvelles technologies, responsabilité civile et pénale Le premier semestre fait l'objet d'un cours dans lequel les sujets suivants sont traités :
- Questions choisies en droit pénal et privé (criminalité informatique, responsabilité contractuelle de l'ingénieur et de l'architecte, responsabilité pour actes illicites, intelligence artificielle et responsabilité).
- Questions choisies dans le domaine de la propriété intellectuelle (droit des brevets et droits d'auteur) et de la protection des données (usages d'internet, vidéosurveillance, etc.) Le second semestre est consacré à la rédaction d'un travail personnel ou en groupe approfondissant l'un des sujets traités dans le cadre du cours.
Le cours vise à faire découvrir les bases du design graphique, ses enjeux, ses différents domaines d'application, ses techniques et ses conventions.
Il s'agit d'un enseignement pratique qui repose sur le développement d'un projet de semestre.

This course provides engineers entering the workforce with a hands-on approach to figuring out what to do in ethically challenging professional situations.
This is a course on the professional ethics of engineering.
Engineering is here regarded as a profession characterised by its own set of principles governing appropriate conduct, with a primary focus on the promotion of the public good or interest.
Following an introduction to the key ethical concepts of value and norm, as well as a survey of the major ethical theories (consequentialism, deontological theories, virtue ethics and care ethics), the course progresses to an examination of core values such as welfare, health, public interest and sustainability.
The NSPE (National Society for Professional Engineers) Code of Ethics is then studied through the resolution of real-world cases during class.
Particular emphasis will be placed on whistleblowing, sexual harassment, and cost-benefit analysis.

Ce cursus particulier - dont l'admission est sujette à l'acceptation d'un dossier de candidature (Les candidats libres ne sont pas acceptés) - offre à l'étudiant engagé dans des études en musique de haut niveau en parallèle à ses études EPFL la possibilité de les faire reconnaître partiellement.
Ce cursus particulier offre à des étudiants engagés dans des études en musique dans un conservatoire ou une haute école la possibilité de faire reconnaître l'équivalence partielle de cette formation afin d'obtenir un allégement de la charge de travail SHS.
Cette équivalence est accordée à partir de la 2e année de Bachelor, sur la base d'un dossier à remettre au Secrétariat du Programme SHS pour le 20 septembre.
Plus d'informations sur la page suivante :
https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/fr/enseignement/shs/equivalence-for-musical-studies/ ATTENTION:
seuls peuvent s'inscrire à cette option les étudiants dont la candidature a été dûment acceptée au préalable par le CDH.
Cet enseignement croise des approches culturelles (notamment dans les domaines littéraires ou artistiques), sociales et scientifiques pour penser les enjeux, les perspectives et les problèmes que soulève l'hybridation de l'humain et de la machine.
L'automatisation de l'humain entre sciences, imaginaires culturels et fictions Des implants électroniques à la robotique inspirée par le vivant, l'hybridation humains-machines est devenue réalité.
Notre environnement, notre travail, nos comportements, nos styles de vie sont notamment informés par notre usage de machines.
Des cours introductifs donneront des informations utiles (un cadre historique et théorique) et proposeront des pistes de recherche.
Puis les étudiant·e·x·s définiront leur problématique et commenceront leur projet par petits groupes.
Ce travail préparatoire aboutira, au semestre de printemps, à la rédaction et à la présentation orale d'un rapport final.
Celui-ci peut prendre trois formes:
Étude critique d'un corpus (composé p.ex.
d'œuvres littéraires, notamment dans les genres du fantastique ou de la science-fiction, de bandes dessinées ou de mangas, de films ou de séries télévisuelles, d'objets ressortissant aux beaux-arts, etc.);
Enquête de terrain (robotique à l'EPFL, interface informatique, automatisation du travail dans l'industrie, prothèses et implants en contexte médical, usages des IAG, etc.);
Création artistique (rédaction d'une nouvelle littéraire, réalisation d'un roman graphique, tournage d'une vidéo, etc.).
Les étudiant·e·x·s feront régulièrement part de l'avancement et des questions que pose leur recherche.
The course considers central themes in the philosophy of science.
Starting from the debate between Leibniz and Newton about space and time, we move on to the transition from classical to quantum physics, the explanatory role of mathematics and philosophical questions about artificial intelligence.
Philosophical perspectives on the exact sciences and their history How did the visions of space and time change from Newton to Einstein?
What is matter following the revolution introduced by quantum physics?
What is a law of nature?
Do mathematical objects really exist?
Can philosophical logic be applied in computer science?
What is the relationship between artificial intelligence and the mind and consciousness?
These questions, among many others, will be tackled in the philosophical reflection on the exact sciences and their history that this master module offers.
Reflecting on these issues provides intellectual tools for a better understanding of today's science and technologies.
After an introductory teaching, the students work in small groups of 2 to 4 students on a particular project and present their intermediate results to the whole group.
Students are free to choose the project that interests them most, but we encourage them to work on a project that is about philosophical issues raised in connection with their main branch at EPFL.

Le cours propose de revenir sur l'Expo 64, exposition nationale suisse de Lausanne en 1964, en invitant à imaginer une réactualisation critique de l'événement dans la perspective d'une hypothétique septième exposition nationale suisse à l'horizon 2034.
L'exposition nationale suisse:
1964/2034 A l'occasion des discussions sur une éventuelle nouvelle exposition nationale suisse à l'horizon 2034, le cours propose de revenir sur celle de 1964 à Lausanne, l'Expo 64.
Celle-ci a non seulement marqué en profondeur la culture et le territoire lausannois, mais a beaucoup compté dans l'histoire de la scénographie des grandes expositions de la seconde moitié du 20e siècle, bien au-delà du seul cadre helvétique.
Le cours de l'automne abordera la manifestation selon des perspectives multiples, la replaçant dans une histoire politique, architecturale, artistique et médiatique des grandes expositions.
Il visera à nourrir une réflexion collective sur le rôle et les formes des expositions nationales, pour préparer la conception d'une hypothétique nouvelle exposition nationale à l'horizon 2034, qu'on proposera de déployer sur le site même de celle de 1964, à Vidy, pour y offrir une réactualisation et une relecture critique de l'événement.
Le cours explore les mythes et les textes fondateurs des cultures antiques (Monde biblique, Grèce, Rome, Egypte).
Explorant leurs significations, leurs réceptions, il s'agit de dérouler une histoire de l'imaginaire qui nous aide à mieux comprendre le caractère hétéroclite de notre propre culture.
Approches anthropologiques Constitution de groupes travaillant sur une thématique mythologique (le choix s'effectue parmi une liste donnée par les enseignants) touchant les aires culturelles étudiées, à savoir le Proche-Orient ancien, l'Égypte, la Grèce et Rome.Il s'agira au second semestre de faire dialoguer cette thématique avec le présent.
Déroulé du 1er semestre :
- Définition du travail en équipe.- Cours de méthodologie- Exemples d'interprétations.- Suivi de l'avancée du dossier à l'occasion de rencontres de travail personnalisées avec chaque groupe.
Déroulé du 2e semestre :
- Projet libre et créatif visant à faire dialoguer le passé et le présent dans une perspective ludique et pédagogique.
Cet enseignement de Psychologie Sociale interroge les écarts entre intentions et comportements, les freins à l'action individuelle et collective, ainsi que les mécanismes de justification morale qui permettent de maintenir l'inaction malgré la conscience des enjeux.
La psychologie sociale de l'(in)action pro-environnementale Objectifs généraux de l'enseignement :
Ce cours explore les causes de l'(in)action pro-environnementale à travers des théories phares de la psychologie sociale.
Il s'appuie sur des recherches pour analyser les écarts entre intentions et comportements, les freins individuels et collectifs (idéologies, mécanismes cognitifs, normes sociales), ainsi que les mécanismes de justification morale (désengagement, licence morale).
Une attention particulière sera portée aux dynamiques d'action collective, en tant que levier de mobilisation et de changement.
Des thématiques appliquées telles que le greenwashing et ses effets sur les employé·es seront également abordées.
Le cours articule apports théoriques, études de cas et initiation à la recherche, afin de permettre aux étudiant·es d'acquérir des savoirs en psychologie sociale environnementale et des compétences méthodologiques.

This course provides a general introduction to Swiss history, its culture, its economy and its political system since 1848 until today.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS COURSE IS FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS ONLY (i.e.
students who did not attend Swiss schools before University).
During the fall semester, two-hour lectures will give a general introduction to Swiss history, culture, economy and politics and discuss Swiss particularities such as the question of languages, the system of direct democracy, Switzerland's strong economic position, and the country's firm engagement on the international scene.
Program:
- Mapping Switzerland - Switzerland as a cultural and political labyrinth - The Wealth of a nation - Switzerland and the world During the spring semester the students will be asked to write a research paper on a specific subject, which they will define and develop in consultation with the instructors.
This course will develop logical reasoning and argumentation skills to enable you to influence decision making.
You will achieve this by learning how to represent and communicate your reasoning as arguments, and by continuously practicing logical reasoning and problem solving in teams.
Good analysts make good arguments:
they can explain the hypotheses underlying their claims, state their assumptions upfront, expose the relevance and reliability of their evidence, and make their logic fully transparent to their audience.
All easier said than done!
The methodology we will use in class to develop these skills is argument diagramming, which is a technique to visually display how explicit and implicit assumptions work together to support a claim (recommendation, opinion, decision, etc.).
By learning how to make reasoning more transparent and to challenge identified assumptions, participants will gain tools that help lay the foundation for productive disagreements, driving better decision-making.
Through argument diagramming and immersive case discussions, you will develop the attitudes and habits of a critical thinker, transferable to analytic work done without argument diagrams.
As you gain experience applying the course concepts and methodologies, you'll analyze and build arguments for several issues with controversial societal and ethical implications.
These issues include hiring based on physical attractiveness,using AI tools in the criminal justice system, and many others.
The fall semester will lay the foundation for your upcoming spring semester project work.
The course aims at the acquisition of concepts and methods of Science and Technology Studies in order to learn how to decipher the intricacies of science and technology in society by mobilizing these elements in relation to the general issues of innovation.
Globalization is the linguistic omnivore of our times.
This course addresses the long history of worldwide encounters and goes behind the rosy vision of a global village.
It gives particular attention to inequalities and to the men and women who fought for alternatives to capitalism.
Globalization rose to conceptual stardom in the 1990s, when the ascent of Western liberal democracy and capitalism looked irresistible.
For some time, that triumph seemed to herald the “end of history,” as political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell.
Since that period, nationalism, wars, racism and inequalities have vastly invalidated the rosy vision of a global village of cultural exchange and of ever-greater understanding.
This course will show that globalization has had a longer history.
Corporations did not wait for a label to be created to invest and make profits on a global scale.
Religions and ideologies conquered the world and inspired revolutions long before CNN, Facebook and Twitter spread information in real time.
Colonialism created empires on which the sun never set, exploiting racism and inequalities that still haunt our world.
This course will investigate the various dimensions of globalization (economic, political, social, military, cultural and environmental) to help students question our contemporary reality from a historical perspective.
Over the course of the class, we will question the view of globalization as a linear, Western, homogenizing process and investigate the power struggles that shaped the advance of capitalism worldwide.
We will go behind the rosy narrative of an ever more integrated world and give particular attention to the social, political and economic inequalities within different assemblages of territories and in terms of authority and rights across time and space (Saskia Sassen).
We will also investigate the roles of the men and women who fought for alternatives to capitalism.
The course will be divided into two related semesters.
During the fall, we will become acquainted with the vast literature on globalization.
We will also visit some international organizations in Geneva to become familiar with those crucial actors of our globalized world.
In the spring, students will use the knowledge they gathered during the previous semester to write an original historical research paper investigating one aspect of globalization.
The aim of the course is to acquire the concepts and methods of Science and Technology Studies in order to learn how to decode the interweaving of science and technology in society by applying these elements to the general issues of innovation.
During the fall semester, this course introduces a series of key notions (path dependence, enrolment, technoscientific promise, etc.) in the sociology of innovation.
During the spring semester, students are asked to mobilize these notions to describe innovations in the making.
Comprendre et discuter les questions centrales de la philosophie des sciences de la vie, par exemple celle du réductionnisme ou pourquoi le libre arbitre pourrait être une illusion.
Transposer les problèmes et les arguments d'un débat à un autre.
Évaluer l'impact de la vision scientifique de nous.
Exemples pour des thèmes possibles du cours :
Les défis du darwinisme, du physicalisme, du réductionnisme et du déterminisme.
Notion de fonction et de dysfonctionnement biologiques Réductionnisme dans les sciences de la vie Frontières des individus biologiques Dilemme du libre arbitre dans un monde physique Nouveau paradigme des systèmes complexes Question d'altruisme biologique et d'éthique En termes de questions ...
Où se situe, le cas échéant, le conflit entre la théorie de l'évolution et la religion ?
Que signifie "dysfonctionnement", que signifie "normal" ou "bien" ?
Existent-ils dans la nature ?
Quelle est la relation entre la biologie et le monde microphysique et celle des différentes théories ?
Qu'est-ce qui fait de nous un individu biologique ?
Sommes-nous libres d'enfreindre les lois de la nature ou sommes-nous entièrement déterminés par les propriétés et les lois physiques ?
Ces questions, parmi beaucoup d'autres, seront abordées dans la réflexion philosophique sur les sciences de la vie proposée par ce module de master.
La réflexion sur ces questions fournit des outils intellectuels permettant de mieux comprendre les sciences et les technologies d'aujourd'hui.
Évaluer les principales positions dans un débat philosophique choisi.
Développer au sein de votre groupe une approche solide d'un ou plusieurs problèmes philosophiques de ce débat.
Défendre votre analyse et vos conclusions.
Voir la description complète du cours dans l'introduction au projet du semestre d'automne HUM-429.Le contenu dépend du projet choisi.
Le sujet du projet doit être lié au cours/séminaire du semestre précédent (HUM-429 Philosophie des sciences de la vie I).
The students will understand the cognitive and social factors which affect learning - particularly in science and engineering.
They will be able to use social research techniques as part of the design process to understand end users.
General Aim:
To enable participants to understand the ways in which professionals learn their profession - with a particular focus on learning in scientific and engineering domains.
General Description of Material:The ability for individuals and organisations to learn is often regarded as central to their survival and success in the contemporary world.
But how do professionals (like engineers) learn their profession?
Learning is partially a psychological concept, but professionals operate in social contexts and so an understanding of professional learning also draws on sociological research.
Therefore understanding professional learning will involve a multi-disciplinary approach.
Plan of the course:Through exploring a number of types of studies on different aspects of learning, participants will build an understanding of concepts from learning sciences.
Students will also participate experiments to give them concrete experiences of adult learning in practice.
Alongside this, student will complete a simple educational design process so they will come to understand the techniques of pedagogical design.
The students will understand the cognitive and social factors which affect learning - particularly in science and engineering.
They will be able to use social research techniques as part of the design process to understand end users.
General Aim:
To enable participants to understand the ways in which professionals learn their profession - with a particular focus on learning in scientific and engineering domains.
General Description of Material:Learning is partially a psychological concept, but professionals operate in social contexts and so an understanding of professional learning also draws on sociological research.
Therefore understanding professional learning will involve a multi-disciplinary approach.
Learning is also messy - multiple difference concepts can apply in different ways at different times.
One way of deepening an understanding of the conceptual complexity of learning is to apply them to the real world through designing a tool that can be used to support learning.
You will need to work in a small team to design a learning object that will integrate concepts of ethics or sustainability into engineering education.
Plan of the course:Students will design a learning object in small diverse teams.
This will require carrying out a review of literature, generating ideas, making choices in situations where there is no perfect solution, developing and testing prototypes, and report writing.
It will also require working effectively in a team (managing communication, managing conflict, managing priroties and work distribution).
Approcher la Chine contemporaine par le biais des phénomènes qui émergent à l'international permet non seulement de s'intéresser à l'impact sur le reste du monde de cette Chine qui s'internationalise, mais aussi de porter le regard sur les transformations de la société chinoise contemporaine.
La Chine hors de Chine En s'intéressant aux individus qui migrent, étudient, voyagent, et aux entreprises qui investissent ou commercent, il est possible de réfléchir aux impacts de l'internationalisation de la Chine dans différents contextes et différents secteurs.
Cet « impact » de l'internationalisation de la Chine ne doit toutefois pas être réduit à un seul impact économique, mais nous permettre aussi de réfléchir aux transformations des manières de faire, de consommer, de se distraire ou de produire dans le monde résultant de l'émergence économique de la Chine.
Aujourd¿hui la culture chinoise s'exporte, et pas seulement par le biais des instituts Confucius ou des médias chinois.
Partout émergent des intermédiaires ou médiateurs locaux de la culture chinoise se réappropriant les pratiques thérapeutiques ou les arts martiaux chinois.
Approcher la Chine contemporaine par le biais de différents phénomènes qui émergent à l'international permet non seulement de s'intéresser à l'impact sur le reste du monde de cette Chine qui s'internationalise, mais aussi de porter le regard sur les transformations de la société chinoise contemporaine.
Nous avons identifié 3 grands thèmes liés à cette thématique de l¿internationalisation de la Chine.
PLAN DU COURS 1) L'internationalisation de l'économie chinoise 2) Les nouvelles formes de mobilités 3) L'internationalisation de la « culture chinoise »
Ce cours traite de la gestion des organisations, et il s'agit d'un cours très fortement focalisé sur la pratique.
En particulier, les participant.e.s apprendront à diriger, mener des projets et pratiquer le leadership.
Les thèmes qui seront abordés peuvent dépendre en partie de l'actualité et des intérêts des étudiant.e.s.
Toutefois, les sujets suivants seront abordés:
- Structure des organisations - Forme juridique des organisations - Management et leadership - Encadrement, comportement organisationnel - Comptabilité, contrôle, finance - Pouvoir - Prise de décisions - Motivation Ces thèmes seront toujours présentés du point de vue théorique, mais aussi discutés ou appliqués du point de vue pratique, avec pour but une bonne compréhension de la pertinence de ceux-ci dans la société actuelle.
Le projet prend une part très importante dans le déroulement du cours, puisque dès le début, les étudiants choissent un projet à portée réelle et apprennent à appliquer les théories pour de vrai.
En plus de thèmes généraux, les étudiant-e-s discuteront de thèmes spécifiques liés au management et à l'économie au sens large, en étudiant les organisations comme les entreprises, les états, les marchés et d'autres éléments de la société ou de l'économie.
ATTENTION:
A titre particulier, certaines sessions théoriques du cours seront annulées certaines semaines.
Ainsi, certains jours, les cours théoriques auront lieu de 16h00 à 19h00 comme prévu à l'horaire, mais quelques autres jours, les sessions seront annnulées.
Ces sessions pourront toutefois être utilisées pour l'avancée dans le projet.
Le but de cet enseignement est de revenir sur les conditions (historiques mais aussi épistémologiques) qui ont permis aux sciences de prendre de l'autonomie par rapport à la religion.
Où en sont les rapports entre science et religion ?
Comment expliquer le développement, à partir des années 1980, de l'idée d'un dialogue entre les sciences et les religions ?
Depuis la naissance de la science moderne au XVIe siècle, l'impossible dialogue - voire le conflit - avec la religion ne cesse de resurgir périodiquement:
au XVIIe siècle avec Galilée, au XVIIIe siècle avec Newton, au XIXe siècle avec Darwin, au XXe siècle avec Einstein ou encore Freud.
Depuis le début des années 1980, on assiste à un regain d'intérêt pour l'idée d'un dialogue entre sciences et religions tant sur des questions d'astronomie, de géologie, d'histoire naturelle que sur la question complexe des origines de l'homme.
Cet enseignement a pour but d'éclairer cette situation particulière où le concordisme se développe.
Plusieurs questions seront abordées :
à quel moment recherche scientifique et croyance religieuse se sont-elles dissociées ?
La religion a-t-elle entravé les progrés de la science ou au contraire a-t-elle influencé positivenent certaines recherches ?
Doit-on - et comment - compartimenter le registre scientifique et celui religieux (principe du NoMA) ?
Plus de science signifie-t-il toujours moins de religion ?
Ce cours propose un regard pluridisciplinaire sur la recherche.
Au-delà du thème traité, des intervenants de différentes facultés (biologie, lettres, EPFL..) apporteront un éclairage sur leur manière propre de pratiquer la recherche.
Au-delà du sujet particulier, ce cours est l'occasion de jeter un regard sur la pluralité des disciplines enseignées à l'université et à l'EPFL, sur ce qui les distingue et les rassemble en matière de curiosité et d'investigation.
Au fil des séances, des intervenantes et intervenants provenant de différentes facultés apporteront un éclairage sur leur manière propre de pratiquer la recherche scientifique.

Ce cours fait partie d'une série de cours interdisciplinaires et collaboratifs ouverts aux étudiants de l'UNIL et de l'EPFL.
Il se concentre sur l'histoire urbaine à travers l'application de méthodes informatiques et le développement d'un projet numérique en groupe.
Ce cours propose une exploration de l'histoire urbaine des villes de l'époque moderne (1700-1950) à travers l'usage de méthodes computationnelles issues de domaines de recherche interdisciplinaires.
Il s'appuie sur l'analyse de sources documentaires inédites - principalement des annuaires du commerce (prédécesseurs des pages jaunes), des recensements et d'autres documents textuels - pour étudier l'évolution morphologique, socio-économique et culturelle de villes telles que Lausanne (ville en transition de l'agriculture à l'urbanité), Paris (capitale en mutation), Venise (ancienne ville-monde marchande), et New York (première grande ville "alpha" de l'histoire contemporaine).
D'autres jeux de données concernant d'autres contextes urbains pourront également être proposés au cours du semestre.
L'objectif principal est de comparer ces cas urbains afin de mettre en lumière similitudes et différences d'un point de vue cartographique, spatial et socio-économique.
Le cours combine des séances à caractère historique (apportant une mise en perspective critique) et des ateliers pratiques, destinés à initier les étudiant·e·s à divers outils logiciels et concepts informatiques, en vue de construire un projet d'analyse urbaine.
Il s'adresse à un public varié :
aux étudiant·e·s en informatique, en sciences de base ou en ingénierie, souhaitant enrichir leur formation par une approche historique fondée sur les humanités digitales ;
aux étudiant·e·s en sciences humaines et sociales, désireux d'explorer les apports des technologies numériques pour la recherche historique et d'interroger les nouvelles dimensions épistémologiques qu'elles soulèvent.
Un accent particulier sera mis sur les méthodologies récentes basées sur l'intelligence artificielle et les modèles de langage (LLM), afin d'en comprendre le potentiel comme les limites dans la reconstruction et la représentation de récits historiques.
Domaines de recherche abordés :
Le développement morphologique des villes et l'analyse de l'espace habité à partir de sources cartographiques, en lien avec l'histoire de l'architecture et l'histoire urbaine ;
L'histoire socio-économique des populations urbaines à partir de sources cadastrales, du registre civil et de la presse locale, explorée à l'aide de méthodes statistiques ;
L'étude du patrimoine culturel et visuel des villes, à travers les sources iconographiques (estampes, photographies, collections visuelles historiques) ;
L'analyse des sources textuelles historiques, en tenant compte de leur évolution linguistique et formelle.
Ce cours, propose 2 options, en anglais et en français :
'Elsewhere Encounters' propose d'explorer différentes approches d'étude de terrain dans le monde artistique ;
'Réalisation' se penche sur les techniques cinématographiques et s'engage dans la réalisation d'un film court.
Option 1 (in English) :
Elsewhere Encounters:
Field Studies This option addresses different approaches of field studies from within the world of artistic practices.
The first semester combines field experiments at a given location with technical inputs, theoretical lectures and case studies around a chosen theme.
Field work aims at testing different digital and analog tools and technologies such as field notes, drawing, photography, generative tools, field recording, software defined radio, electromagnetic fields capture, and photogrammetry scans in order to gather and exploit data sets as a way towards a personal rereading of these spaces.
Theoretical lectures and case studies aim at contextualizing and discussing students' experiments according to past and present artistic practices and research in a critical perspective.
Over the course of the second semester, students in groups of two design and produce a project based on the skills, methods and knowledge acquired during the first semester and their own tools.
The project is based on the selection of a place and a field of action.
It must fit the semester work topic which is the relation in between the technosphere and nature.
The brief of the project is defined with the lecturers and its conceptual and formal developments are supervised on a weekly basis during tutoring sessions.
Two group presentations are planned.
The mid-term presentation includes a statement, sketches, a scenario and tests made at early stages to ensure the feasibility and potential of their project.
At the end of the semester, a model, a probe or a prototype, a field performance, an installation, a game or a video is presented in order to assess the project outcomes.
The final artifacts are presented for assessment along with a report and illustrations of the process, showing its strengths, weaknesses and the challenges encountered.
Regular attendance is essential for this course.
A part of the grade is dedicated to this.
Option 2 (en français):
Réalisation d'un court métrage documentaire.
Les étudiants visionneront des extraits de films et des courts métrages suivi d'une discussion sur la méthodologie/le dispositif des cinéastes étudiés.
A partir de quelques exercices, chaque binôme développera une idée de film centrée sur la notion de "lieu".
Ce projet sera discuté de manière collective afin d'en explorer les intentions, d'en analyser la faisabilité et d'imaginer les outils avec lesquels les étudiants pourraient le mener.
Ainsi, chaque étudiante entraînera sa capacité d'observation, d'écoute et de réaction lors du tournage.
En amont, une transmission des techniques de base aura lieu, assurée par des professionnels du métier.
Les étudiants entraineront en matière de son, d'image et de lumière naturelle pour assurer l'aspect formel du film.
Des séances de visionnement des rushes seront organisées pour munir les équipes de travail de nouveaux outils en fonction de l'expérience en cours.
Tout le matériel nécessaire à la réalisation du court métrage sera fourni en classe.
Une initiation au logiciel Adobe Premiere Pro est prévue ainsi qu'à un accompagnement pendant le processus de montage.
Les films terminés seront projetés en salle, suivis d'une discussion et défense de chaque projet, en présence d'un jury externe.
Pour l'évaluation, la qualité des courts métrages sera prise en compte ainsi que le processus par lequel les étudiants seront passés pendant la création de ce dernier.

en principe deux disciplines Votre projet vous permet de vous initier (de manière théorique et/ou pratique) à une méthode/approche/technique scientifique qui vous est peu familière et que vous n’aurez pas l’occasion d’aborder dans le cadre de vos études et/ou travail de mémoire.
Au cours de votre projet, vous prenez contact, rencontrez et discutez de la question traitée avec au moins un/e scientifique, expert dans la méthode/approche/technique scientifique que vous voulez explorer.
The media frequently report on trendy studies in experimental cognitive psychology, and which inform the public on human functioning and its causes.
We teach students basic skills and requirements when performing, understanding and comprehending such studies, through the angle of replication crisis.

We study the alleged value-neutrality of artefacts, the way values are realized in society and consequently influenced by artefacts, and, finally, the claims that technology is invariably the solution or part of the problem.
The teacher illustrates this approach through examples drawn from their own research in the ethics of social robotics and AI.
In the second part of the course, the students are required to put this approach into practice.
Having formed groups, they will select an artefact of their choosing and provide an ethical analysis.
Finally, each group will present their analysis to the rest of the class.
Ce cours traite de la gestion des organisations, allant de l'entrepreneuriat à l'encadrement dans les entreprises.

Globalization is the linguistic omnivore of our times.
This course addresses the long history of worldwide encounters and goes behind the rosy vision of a global village.
It gives particular attention to inequalities and to the men and women who fought for alternatives to capitalism.
Globalization rose to conceptual stardom in the 1990s, when the ascent of Western liberal democracy and capitalism looked irresistible.
For some time, that triumph seemed to herald the “end of history,” as political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell.
Since that period, nationalism, wars, racism and inequalities have vastly invalidated the rosy vision of a global village of cultural exchange and of ever-greater understanding.
This course will show that globalization has had a longer history.
Corporations did not wait for a label to be created to invest and make profits on a global scale.
Religions and ideologies conquered the world and inspired revolutions long before CNN, Facebook and Twitter spread information in real time.
Colonialism created empires on which the sun never set, exploiting racism and inequalities that still haunt our world.
This course will investigate the various dimensions of globalization (economic, political, social, military, cultural and environmental) to help students question our contemporary reality from a historical perspective.
Over the course of the class, we will question the view of globalization as a linear, Western, homogenizing process and investigate the power struggles that shaped the advance of capitalism worldwide.
We will go behind the rosy narrative of an ever more integrated world and give particular attention to the social, political and economic inequalities within different assemblages of territories and in terms of authority and rights across time and space (Saskia Sassen).
We will also investigate the roles of the men and women who fought for alternatives to capitalism.
The course will be divided into two related semesters.
During the fall, we will become acquainted with the vast literature on globalization.
We will also visit some international organizations in Geneva to become familiar with those crucial actors of our globalized world.
In the spring, students will use the knowledge they gathered during the previous semester to write an original historical research paper investigating one aspect of globalization.
For further information, see the full description of the course in History of globalization I (HUM-427a).
Cet enseignement croise des approches culturelles (notamment dans les domaines littéraires ou artistiques), sociales et scientifiques pour penser les enjeux, les perspectives et les problèmes que soulève l'hybridation de l'humain et de la machine.

Le cours examine de manière ouverte les constructions de la Nature par diverses sciences et cultures.
Il met l'accent sur la pluralité des modes d'apparition de la Nature et sur les rôles qui lui sont prêtés, notamment dans l'opposition avec l'artifice.
Voir le descriptif complet dans l'introduction au projet "Images de la nature I" HUM-409(a) du semestre d'automne.
Based on the knowledge acquired during the fall semester course (Understanding modern Switzerland I), students are asked to work by group of 3-4 students and prepare a paper on a topic previously discussed with the teachers.
See the full description of the course in the "Introduction to project" of the fall semester (HUM-422).
Le séminaire propose de concevoir une série de contributions ponctuelles à une hypothétique exposition nationale suisse en 2034 qui prendrait la forme d'une réactualisation de l'Expo 64 sur le site même de l'exposition nationale de Lausanne de 1964.
L'exposition nationale suisse, 1964/2034 Dans le prolongement du cours de l'automne sur l'Expo 64, exposition nationale suisse de Lausanne en 1964, le séminaire proposera aux étudiant·e·s d'imaginer une série de contributions ponctuelles à une hypothétique septième exposition nationale suisse sur le site même de celle de 1964, à Vidy.
Ces projets chercheront à investir les vestiges de 1964 pour y déployer une réactualisation et une relecture critique de l'événement.
Dans le cadre du Montreux Jazz Digital Project, ce cours propose de créer et de publier des podcasts (FR/ENG) à partir d'interviews sur les coulisses du festival.
Il vise à développer des connaissances critiques et pratiques dans les dynamiques de numérisation et de valorisation du patrimoine.
Les technologies numériques renouvellent profondément les modes de définition, de collecte et de mise en valeur des patrimoines matériels et immatériels.
Dans le but d'interroger, par la pratique, ces nouvelles dynamiques patrimoniales, ce cours propose aux étudiant·e·s de s'engager dans le Montreux Jazz Digital Project, un projet impulsé par l'EPFL et la Fondation Claude Nobs et le Montreux Jazz Festival.
Ce projet couvre plusieurs volets :
- La numérisation et la valorisation de la collection d'enregistrements des concerts du Montreux Jazz Festival inscrite en 2013 au Registre de la Mémoire du Monde de l'UNESCO.
- L'innovation et la recherche dans les domaines de l'audiovisuel, du traitement du signal, de l'acoustique, de la musicologie, des neurosciences, du design, de l'architecture ou de la muséologie, de l'intelligence artificielle et de bien d'autres.
- La collecte et la mise en valeur de la mémoire de la communauté du festival au travers d'un projet d'histoire publique et numérique (Montreux Jazz Memories).
Durant le semestre d'automne, les étudiant·e·s sont plongé·e·s dans une collection d'interviews (en français et en anglais) portant sur les coulisses du festival afin d'en analyser certaines thématiques.
Encadrés par une équipe pluridisciplinaire formée d'ingénieurs, anthropologues et journalistes, les étudiant·e·s créent par groupe plusieurs podcasts et les mettent en valeur sur la plateforme notreHistoire.ch.
Pour ce faire, ils se familiarisent avec les outils de fabrication de posdacst (ELAN, Reaper et Hindenburg).
Ils ont également la possibilité d'interviewer certain.es acteurs et actrices du festival.
Au semestre de printemps, les étudiant·e·s se consacrent à la collecte de nouvelles interviews dans le cadre de rencontres et d'ateliers, participant ainsi de manière active au projet Montreux Jazz Memories.
Ces témoignages audio sont réalisés auprès des acteurs et des actrices du festival (Staff, organisateurs·rices, Montreusien.ne.s, artistes).
Travaillant par groupe, les étudiant·e·s proposent une thématique personnelle et identifient les personnes à interviewer.
Ils disposent à cet effet d'outils de capture professionnelle tel qu'enregistreurs Nagra.
Ils éditent ensuite leur podcast et le publie sur notreHistoire.ch.

In this seminar, students work in groups to prepare a report illustrating material taught in the first semester.
Specifically, the groups will choose a significant environmental impact or resource use, and apply decomposition analysis to understand the role of the underlying drivers.
A convenient way to understand the evolution of an environmental impact (e.g., polluting emissions, depletion of a natural resource) is to relate the time series of that impact to the time series of the corresponding population, its economic activity and living standard, and technical determinants.
This IPAT decomposition helps predict the future evolution of the impact and guides possible proposals for policy measures to reduce that impact.
More generally, decomposition analysis can help understand how main drivers explain the evolution of an impact or differences in impact levels across regions or countries.
Students will work in groups of four, first finding an environmental impact that they want to analyse, then, collecting the data needed to understand its evolution through time in the IPAT framework.
Next, they will analyse the data, referring to the scientific literature, and derive recommendations of policy measures for reducing the environmental impact.
The environmental impact can be local, national, international.
This course examines growth from various angles:
economic growth, growth in the use of resources, need for growth, limits to growth, sustainable growth, population growth.
Although grounded in economics, it takes up elements from many other disciplines.

Alliant numérique et histoire, ce cours propose une approche renouvelée de l'histoire des médias.
En explorant les archives de presse numérisées à l'aide d'outils numériques, les étudiant·es apprendront à analyser de manière critique les données massives du passé.
Comprendre l'histoire par les données.
Comprendre les données par l'histoire La presse est depuis longtemps une source mobilisée par les historiennes et les historiens.
La numérisation des archives de presse depuis une quinzaine d'années ainsi que, plus récemment, le développement de nouveaux outils numériques renouvellent en profondeur la façon d'explorer ces sources.
À travers l'analyse d'archives de presse numérisées, l'objectif de ce cours UNIL/EPFL est d'allier enseignement et recherche sur, d'une part, la fabrication, la diffusion et la conservation de l'information et, d'autre part, les méthodologies des Digital Humanities appliquées à l'analyse de données historiques, comme la fouille de texte (text mining) et la visualisation (data visualization).
Cette année, nous nous intéresserons plus particulièrement aux dynamiques d'influence à l'oeuvre dans les écoystèmes médiatiques durant le long XXe siècle.
Nous observerons les médias de manière critique, en les considérant comme des acteurs participant activement à la formation des représentations collectives au sein de la société.
En effet, loin de se limiter à un simple miroir de la réalité, les titres de presse participent à la diffusion d'une certaine vision du monde à travers leurs choix éditoriaux, que ce soit par les angles adoptés, les voix relayées ou encore par les informations mises en avant, voire délibérément écartées.
Nous analyserons comment la sélection, la hiérarchisation et la mise en forme de l'information résultent de mécanismes d'influence diversifiés et de processus complexes de négociation.
Pour comprendre ces mécanismes et processus, nous considérerons les médias comme un écosystème organisé qui interagit avec son environnement social, politique, économique et culturel.
Ce terme, que nous empruntons à l'écologie, décrit bien deux aspects que nous voulons étudier à travers le prisme des contenus publiés :
l'interaction des médias avec leur environnement et l'organisation/le fonctionnement de la sphère médiatique elle-même.
Le cours portera une attention particulière à la notion d'influence, entendue comme la présence de traces - celles d'acteurs individuels ou collectifs, de valeurs, ou encore de logiques institutionnelles - qui participent à l'élaboration et à la diffusion de l'information.
À travers l'analyse de cas concrets tirés de la presse suisse, nous analyserons la médiatisation d'événements et de phénomènes historiques et développerons les outils nécessaires pour décrypter les mécanismes de production de l'information et ses enjeux contemporains.
L'objectif du cours consistera à observer dans quelle mesure la mobilisation d'outils numériques nous permettra d'aborder et de déceler principalement deux types d'influences qui s'exercent sur les médias :
(1) l'influence extérieure et (2) l'influence entre les médias.
(1) L'influence extérieure comprend la capacité des acteurs (par exemple, les groupes sociaux ou les institutions) à faire représenter leurs programmes dans les médias (agenda setting, relais des normes dominaires, etc.).
(2) Des luttes d'influence ont également lieu entre les institutions médiatiques.
Le choix des sources d'information, ainsi que la manière dont les messages ont été repris d'un média à l'autre, révèlent les rapports de force entre les médias et mettent en lumière la manière dont l'influence s'exerce entre les médias.
De manière plus générale, l'enjeu de cet enseignement est de donner certains clés de compréhension du monde d'aujourd'hui :
des clés historiques pour comprendre la fabrication de l'information, dans le passé et à l'heure actuelle ;
des clés méthodologiques pour comprendre et maîtriser des concepts et outils d'analyse de données ;
des clés critiques pour évaluer et analyser le flux d'informations auquel nous sommes exposés tous les jours.
Cette année, les étudiant-es, réunis dans la mesure du possible dans des groupes mixtes (EPFL/UNIL), utiliseront comme source principale des archives de la presse suisse pour mener à bien leur projet de recherche interdisciplinaire.
Objectifs de l'enseignement Comprendre/mettre à jour les dynamiques à l'oeuvre au sein des écosystèmes médiatiques et leur impact sur la façon d'informer.
Proposer un aperçu large des enjeux liés à l'histoire des médias et du journalisme.
Développer l'esprit critique des étudiant-es face aux médias et à l'information.
Accompagner la réalisation d'un projet de recherche historique, fondé sur l'exploitation des sources historiques numérisées et en ligne.
Donner aux étudiant-es les moyens d'utiliser les documents et archives en ligne, de développer leur esprit critique vis-à-vis des ressources en ligne, d'utiliser des outils numériques d'analyse de données performants, mais ne demandant pas nécessairement de recours au développement informatique.

Ce cours permet aux étudiant·e·s d'acquérir des connaissances théoriques et pratiques sur les enjeux liés à la transition écologique et sociale.
Il comprend des enseignements interdisciplinaires, ainsi qu'un travail de groupe sur des études de cas situées sur le campus ou dans le canton de Vaud.
Il s'agit ici du deuxième semestre d'un cours conçu comme un cours annuel (cf.
section prérequis) Le cours permet aux étudiant·e·s d'acquérir des connaissances théoriques concernant les enjeux liés à la durabilité et à la transition écologique et sociale, ainsi que des compétences sur le plan du travail interdisciplinaire, de la pensée systémique et de la résolution pratique de problèmes complexes.
Il abordera les enjeux de la transition écologique et sociale du point de vue de disciplines aussi variées que les sciences de l'environnement, l'économie, l'analyse des politiques publiques ou l'urbanisme.
Dans la partie pratique du cours, les étudiant·e·s seront invité·e·s à se pencher sur un aspect particulier des enjeux et de la mise en oeuvre de la transition écologique, sur le campus UNIL-EPFL ou dans le Canton de Vaud.
Les étudiant·e·s travailleront en groupe sur des questions concrètes proposées par des acteurs/trices de la transition du campus et du canton.
1er semestre (Transition écologique:
entre théorie & pratique I):
Le semestre débutera par une introduction sur l'organisation du cours, ses objectifs et le cadre théorique général de la transition écologique et sociale.
Par la suite, les étudiant.e.s bénéficieront d'une combinaison d'apports théoriques et d'activités pratiques sur la transition écologique et sociale, notamment à travers d'un projet de recherche sur un aspect concret du campus UNIL-EPFL et dans le territoire vaudois, en collaboration avec les acteurs/trices du terrain.
Le semestre sera consacré dans un premier temps à la définition des objectifs de la transition, en se concentrant sur quelques thèmes clés, tels que climat, biodiversité, gestion de l'énergie, et objectifs sociaux, ainsi qu'aux leviers qui permettent d'organiser la transition et de la mettre en pratique.
Ces instruments, ainsi que leurs limites et les difficultés qu'ils peuvent poser, seront illustrés par des exemples concrets dans différents secteurs d'activité (mobilité, énergie, urbanisme, consommation, etc.).
Dans un deuxième temps, les étudiant.e.s commenceront à travailler en groupe sur des projets proposés par les acteurs/trices de terrain susmentionné.e.s, et en collaboration avec ceux/celles-ci.
Ce travail de groupe se poursuivra tout au long du deuxième semestre.
L'objectif du premier semestre est d'identifier la problématique et les enjeux du projet, de réaliser une cartographie des parties prenantes, et d'établir un plan de travail en vue du deuxième semestre.
2ème semestre (Transition écologique:
entre théorie & pratique II):
Le second semestre sera principalement consacré aux projets de groupe.
Les étudiant·e·s continueront à travailler sur un projet de la transition écologique et/ou sociale du campus UNIL-EPFL ou du Canton de Vaud, dans la continuité du premier semestre.
Il leur sera demandé d'approfondir leur analyse des enjeux et des parties prenantes, et de déterminer quelles sont les opportunités et les facteurs de blocage liés au projet, afin d'en évaluer les évolutions futures possibles et de formuler des recommandations.
Ces analyses devront être réalisées au plus proche des réalités du terrain, en s'appuyant éventuellement sur des discussions avec les parties prenantes.
Il est également attendu des étudiant·e·s qu'ils/elles fassent preuve d'une certaine créativité en proposant des solutions innovantes aux problèmes identifiés.
Des échanges entre les différents groupes pourront également être organisés afin de ne pas perdre de vue la vision globale de la transition.
Les dernières séances du semestre seront consacrées à la présentation des projets.
Most of us aspire to live meaningful lives.
Yet, many of us would struggle to explain what a meaningful life is.
This course provides philosophical tools and frameworks useful to understand our aspiration for meaning.
General Description Most of us aspire to live meaningful lives.
Yet, many of us would struggle to explain what a meaningful life is.
This course provides philosophical tools and frameworks useful to understand our aspiration for meaning.
The philosophical ideals of clarity and truth will guide us throughout the semester.
In particular, the course examines the role that emotions and values play in defining the self (i.e., roughly, who we are) and making our lives meaningful.
It does so by focusing on life-defining moments such as transformative experiences and life's hard choices--big or small.
Going to EPFL, falling in love, converting to a religion, emigrating to a new country, or becoming a vampire (should the latter possibility be offered to you) are experiences and choices that may change you profoundly.
The course explores the special and distinct ways in which life-defining moments relate to our emotions and our values.
For instance, love may trigger transformation by changing your core values and confront you with hard choices, such as the choice between the status quo or moving with your life partner far away from your friends and family.
As daunting as life-defining moments are, they may also constitute unique occasions to exercise a special power of ours:
the power to change our values and, ultimately, who we are.
Some philosophers believe that life-defining moments resemble paradigm changes in the sciences, a resemblance that may help our understanding of both personal transformation and scientific transformation.
The course offers a philosophical perspective on the above questions while drawing from other disciplines such as classical studies, cognitive science, economics, law, and psychology.
In light of this interdisciplinary approach, a renowned expert in one of these fields is expected to join us for a guest lecture.
The exploration of philosophical theories about emotion, value, the self, and its transformations will not provide students with definite responses about what they should do to lead meaningful lives.
However, through philosophical reflection on these topics, students will acquire essential tools to find--autonomously--meaning in (i) their personal or professional paths and (ii) the varied human communities and organizations to which they belong and that they may come to lead.
The course has the following three parts.
(1) Transformation, Values in Virtual Reality, and the Emotions of Life-Defining Moments--with an introduction to philosophy and the philosophical method We will begin with an overview of the semester's philosophical program and address all questions regarding the work expected from students.
In particular, we will discuss (i) transformative experience in connection to paradigm shifts in the sciences (philosophy of the self, philosophy of science),(ii) what the possibility of a good life in virtual reality teaches us about value (philosophy of value, value theory, ethics), and(ii) what role some emotions may play in life-defining moments (philosophy of mind, philosophy of emotions).
We will raise questions such as the following:
Which events have changed you?
How has attending EPFL affected who you are?
What roles do (your) values play in shaping who you are?
Do emotions constitute ways of being in touch with (your) values?
These questions will follow us throughout the semester.
During this introductory part of the course, we will also go over grading modalities (writing assignments, discussion chairing, class participation, etc.) and grading criteria.
The instructor will introduce students to philosophy as a discipline and to the philosophical method specifically.
For instance, the philosophical emphasis on clarity, concision, and truth will be highlighted by considering Edmund Gettier's famous "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?"--a three-page paper that fundamentally changed our understanding of knowledge--and Harry Frankfurt's article "On Bullshit".
As suggested above, the overview of the semester's philosophical program will reveal that values and emotions play a crucial role in defining the self and its transformations.
This result will confront us with two questions:
What is value?
What is an emotion?
(2) Value The second part of the course introduces students to the philosophy of value, also called value theory.
In this section of the course, we will follow one quest:
defining value(s).
At first sight, values include things such as moral goodness, beauty, the sacred, and justice, and values are related to yet differ from other normative notions, such as the right to vote.
Moreover, we will adopt the following working hypothesis:
Something is a (positive) value if and only if the more there is of that thing, the better the world is.
A distinctive feature of this working hypothesis is that it seemingly treats value like a quantity or a magnitude.
Nevertheless, we will see that in many regards, values differ from familiar empirically measurable quantities or magnitudes.
For instance, while the mass of any object A is equal, greater than, or smaller than the mass of another object B, some philosophers believe that the value of an object A may be neither equal, nor greater than, nor smaller than the value of a (different) object B;
the two objects may be, to put it roughly, incommensurable value-wise.
The possibly life-defining choice between going to EPFL or attending a prestigious Law school may be hard for that precise reason:
the two options may be incommensurable value-wise.
So, something in the nature of values seems relevant to the structure of at least some transformative decisions and hard choices.
As we progress in our quest to define value, we will come across types of values less commonly known than those already mentioned.
For example, the traditional opposition between instrumental value and intrinsic value has shaped much of value theory.
Indeed, some things have value only in virtue of what they can help us obtain (i.e., instrumental value;
think of, e.g., money), whereas other things have value in themselves (i.e., intrinsic value;
think of, e.g., happiness).
In contrast to things that have only instrumental value, things that have intrinsic value are traditionally thought to provide a foundation for our moral lives.
Another important distinction is the contrast between the personal value of, say, a quickly snatched picture of you and your friends at the entrance of EPFL's Rolex Building and the impersonal value of a professionally taken, much more sophisticated picture of the entrance of the same Rolex Building.
With such distinctions, we will be able to ask which specific types of values are at stake in life-defining moments and which emotions, if any, give us access to these specific types of values.
(3) Emotion The third part of the course introduces students to the philosophy of mind while paying special attention to the affective domain within the mind.
In this section of the course, we will follow one quest:
defining emotion.
At first sight, emotions include phenomena such as hope, joy, grief, compassion, love, nostalgia, shame, and pride.
But we will see that some of these phenomena may not be emotions:
indeed, we will distinguish emotions from other mental states, such as beliefs, and other affective phenomena, such as moods and "sentiments".
Our starting point to define emotion will be the following working hypothesis:
Any instance of an emotion is (i) about something relatively specific (e.g., typically, one is proud of something, say, of completing one's master's degree), (ii) feels a relatively specific way that resembles how other instances of the same emotion feel (e.g., experiences of pride resemble each other in the way they feel, but they feel different from experiences of shame), and (iii) may be appropriate or not (e.g., it is appropriate to be proud of completing one's master's degree).
However, we will see that this working hypothesis about emotion is rather ambitious.
Finding a definition of emotion that satisfies (i), (ii), and (iii) has proved difficult for many philosophers, including those, for instance, who view emotions as being, ultimately, sensations of pleasure and displeasure or those who view emotions as being, ultimately, value judgments.
As we progress in our quest to define emotion, we will come to consider the following intriguing possibility:
emotions give us access to values and may thus constitute an affective compass to navigate our moral lives.
Sometimes, that compass helps us protect ourselves from "mental corruption" by reminding us of our values.
Nevertheless, at other times, this compass helps us face life's hard choices and transform who we are by embracing new values.

A word about philosophy and philosophy courses in general Philosophers have long been famous for their disputationes (i.e., debates).
Indeed, exchanges play a central role in philosophy.
Students should come to class prepared to discuss the mandatory reading assignments.
The selected mandatory readings are, generally speaking, short and accessible, and they stand out as pleasant, if not entertaining, reads that shaped the subsequent philosophical discussion.
The more difficult the readings will be, the fewer pages will be assigned so that students have time to engage with the readings and reflect on them.
Furthermore, the instructor will provide advice on how to read efficiently, particularly on how to read philosophy efficiently.
The main mission of students with regard to readings and class materials is to reflect on them and come up with their own questions, thoughts, objections, claims, and arguments.
The goal of this course is not for the students to remember every detail of the readings or the course materials.
Readings and class materials are starting points to help students develop their own thoughts on emotion, value, and the self.
In fact, some of the best extant philosophy results from "misunderstanding" or "misreading" some idea in past philosophical works and building on that misunderstanding to get closer to the truth of a certain matter.
Note:
The instructor may adjust the content and structure of the course described above to a reasonable extent, in particular at the beginning of the semester, when the instructor will be able to assess more accurately the needs of enrolled students.
The guest lecture mentioned above is yet to be confirmed and is subject to approval by the College of Humanities.
In this master's project seminar, students prepare a high-quality article embodying the philosophical ideals of clarity, concision, and aspiration to truth.
Students also defend the claim made in their article by delivering a professional presentation.
During the Fall semester (HUM-478), we examined the role that emotions and values play in defining the self (i.e., roughly, who we are) and making our lives meaningful.
We did so partly by focusing on life-defining moments, such as transformative experiences and some of life's hard choices.
The instructor introduced students to philosophy and the philosophical method.
Moreover, the instructor presented strategies to deliver an effective presentation and to write a clear and concise article.
Students practiced presenting, chairing a discussion, and writing through their assignments for the Fall semester.
The instructor and peers provided feedback on the students' assignments.
In this master's project seminar, students will act on what they learned during the Fall.
Partly in teams and partly individually, students will prepare a high-quality article based on the short essay and the personal addendum submitted in the Fall.
Additionally, every team will present its work-in-progress to the rest of the class and defend the claim made in its article.
Students will receive feedback from both the instructor and their peers.
Both the article and the presentation should convey professionalism and aim at the philosophical ideals of clarity, concision, and truth.
Like in the Fall, a renowned expert in a field relevant to the topics of the course is expected to join us for a guest lecture.

Critical Thinking II (HUM 484) builds on concepts acquired in Critical Thinking I (HUM 425).
Please read HUM 425 for Critical Thinking I & Critical Thinking II course contents, transversal skills, learning outcomes, and course methodologies.
These two courses are offered together only.
This course provides students with insights into how law shapes our increasingly digital and artificially intelligent environments and how the law itself gets shaped within that process and is designed for students who want to critically examine the interplay of law and computation.
Both law and computation have been permeating our private and professional lives:
The law has done so for thousands of years already by determining the social and economic structures in which we interact, while in comparison, digitalization only much more recently has been transforming our societal fabric.
Understanding how the law can enable or constrain innovation within the broad domain of computation or digitalization is central for developers and engineers to determine how to shape future, responsible computing as well as regulatory environments.
Within this course, we will analyze the regulatory toolkit at the disposition of policymakers and map legislations that emerged in Switzerland, Europe, and selected jurisdictions across the globe.
We will analyze how the field of digital law has shifted over the years, more recently with a focus on data driven computing and machine learning, and aiming to achieve trustworthy artificial intelligence.
We will critically reflect on the shortcomings of current legislation and envisage new approaches to address new risks that an ever-artificially intelligent world entails.
This opens up the discussion to newer approaches and domains of law, that are focused on how computation and design can improve legal processes and access to law and justice.
These new approaches are situated within the field of regulatory innovation, legal design, and computational law and combine the expertise of computer scientists, human-computer interaction designers, and legal scholars and are often driven by the quest to leverage interdisciplinary know-how to create more accessible legal processes.
This course provides students with insights into how law shapes our increasingly digital and artificially intelligent environments and how the law itself gets shaped within that process and is designed for students who want to critically examine the interplay of law and computation.
Impliquez-vous dans l'éducation à la durabilité grâce aux théories de l'apprentissage, à la facilitation et les réflexions sur l'écosysteme d'éducation.
Développez vos compétences pour enseigner des problèmes complexes et encadrer des étudiant·es de bachelor dans un cours de durabilité (ENV-101).
L'enseignement et la facilitation d'apprentissage des problèmes complexes de durabilité reposent sur la capacité des facilitateurs·e à créer des opportunités d'apprentissage efficaces et à identifier la progression de l'apprentissage des étudiant·es.
Dans ce cours, vous apprendrez comment l'apprentissage et l'enseignement sont liés, et comment les compétences transversales, telles que la réflexion, la pensée systémique, et l'écoute active, jouent un rôle dans l'apprentissage.
L'objectif de ce cours est d'offrir une base solide sur ces différents aspects, et de vous permettre d'acquérir une compréhension fines des problématiques complexes liées à la pédagogie de la durabilité.
Le cours est organisé en 3 parties:
Théories de l'apprentissage - comment les adultes acquièrent des connaissances et des compétences sur des sujets complexes, théories sur l'apprentissage et l'écosystème éducatif Pratique de la facilitation - au travers des exemples et de la pratique, nous explorons comment la facilitation est liée à notre perception de l'apprentissage ou de ce qui fait un "bon" enseignement, à la création d'opportunités d'apprentissage, ainsi qu'au renforcement du développement des compétences transversales nécessaires pour comprendre les enjeux de la durabilité Réflexions sur l'écosystème d'éducation - cette partie explore le rôle des acteurs éducatifs dans l'enseignement de la durabilité, en soulignant les responsabilités des facilitateurs·rices.
Elle aborde aussi la pensée systémique en éducation, l'importance des émotions dans l'apprentissage, et le rôle des communautés de pratique pour soutenir le changement.
Les concepts essentiels en matière de durabilité seront également abordés tout au long du semestre de manière transversale.
Cela permettra de préparer les étudiant·es à leur projet pratique du second semestre, qui consiste à animer les ateliers hebdomadaires d'un grand cours de Ba2 sur la durabilité (ENV-101).
Le projet pratique du second semestre suppose donc la présence des etudiant·es lors de ces ateliers le mardi soir (17h-19h).
Les séances de cours du mercredi seront dédiées à la préparation et au debriefing de ces ateliers.
Cet enseignement est une introduction à la théorie et la pratique de la médiation scientifique.
Cette année, ce cours aboutira à la création et l'animation d'un atelier pédagogique et interactif avec un groupe de jeunes.

Comment les IA génératives transforment nos manières de lire, d'écrire et de penser ?
Pour répondre à cette question, il faut analyser l'écriture assistée par IA génératives à l'aide des concepts et des méthodes de la linguistique et de la génétique des textes.
Depuis le lancement de ChatGPT en novembre 2022, l'utilisation popularisée des IA génératives font l'objet de débats, écologiques, éthiques, philosophiques ou juridiques, particulièrement vifs.
Vantée par ses développeurs et certains de ses utilisateurs pour ses capacités inédites de production de textes, elle est redoutée par de nombreux intellectuels et pédagogues, qui y voient un risque majeur d'affaiblissement des compétences cognitives et langagières, et fait craindre à de nombreuses professions une dévalorisation, voire une disparition de ce qui faisait la particularité de leur métier (on pense ici tout particulièrement aux autrices et auteurs, scénaristes, journalistes, traductrices et traducteurs, etc.).
Si le débat social sur cette question est essentiel, il lui faut, pour avancer, des données et un cadre, théorique et méthodologique, qui permettent d'apprécier l'effet de ces technologies sur les textes, les processus de création et les compétences de leurs agents.
C'est ce que propose de construire ce cours.
Car pour apprécier les conséquences des technologies qui se développement actuellement à grand train, il ne faut pas seulement expliquer comment elles fonctionnent, mais il faut surtout étudier les propriétés des textes qu'on produit avec ces technologies et la manière dont celles-ci transforment nos pratiques et nos compétences.
Le cours-séminaire s'organisera autour des questions suivantes :
Peut-on caractériser aujourd'hui les textes qui ont été produits « par » l'IA générative ?
Ceux-ci ont-ils un style qu'on pourrait dire « artificiel », au sens où quelque chose des textes « naturels » s'y serait perdu ?
(i.) L'utilisation des IAG instaure-t-elle de nouveaux protocoles d'écriture, de nouvelles manières d'écrire (de nouveaux « styles de genèse ») ?
(ii.) Comment le recours à l'IAG en situation d'écriture affecte, positivement ou négativement, l'acquisition des compétences langagières ?
(iii).
Pour préciser ces questions et y apporter des réponses, le cours s'appuiera sur les cadres théoriques de la linguistique et de la génétique des textes (approche des processus d'écriture).
Les données textuelles à partir desquelles nous travaillerons seront des écrits professionnels de tout type :
littéraires (prose et poésie), journalistiques, scientifiques, médicales, etc.
Le cours donnera l'occasion aux participants d'apprendre à récolter des données textuelles, à les caractériser (fonctions sociales et propriétés textuelles), à élaborer des protocoles expérimentaux permettant d'apprécier les effets des IAG sur les textes et leur invention.
Cet enseignement est une introduction à la théorie et la pratique de la médiation scientifique.
Voir le descriptif complet dans l'Introduction au projet du semestre d'automne HUM-490 "Médiation scientifique I".

Dans ce projet de groupe, explorez les pratiques pédagogiques dans un cours de durabilité.
L'observation, la formulation de problèmes, la préparation en groupe, et la réflexion sur l'enseignement de la durabilité, vous aideront à développer des stratégies pour enseigner les problèmes complexes.
Le débriefing, la réflexion et la planification de la pratique de la facilitation des atelierst font partie des éléments essentiels au développement des compétences pédagogiques et à la création d'environnements d'apprentissage, ce qui est particulièrement important pour faciliter l'apprentissage des problèmes complexes de durabilité et soutenir le développement des compétences transversales pour les étudiants en Bachelor.
Ce projet offrira aux étudiants l'opportunité d'apprendre par la pratique, en facilitant l'apprentissage d'autres étudiants individuellement et en groupe, suivi par des sessions qui offriront une réflexion et une préparation guidées.
Le projet est soutenu par un modèle graduel de réflexion qui améliore la pratique de l'enseignement et la posture des facilitateurs face aux étudiants :
l'observation de l'environnement de la classe et du rôle du praticien dans cet environnement.
l'identification des problèmes pédagogiques dans leur propre pratique en tant que participant au processus d'apprentissage.
la réflexion critique sur sa propre pratique et retour d'information par les pairs - au cours des semaines suivantes, les réflexions seront renforcées par des considérations sur les approches théoriques, complétées par un retour d'information par les pairs et par eux-mêmes.
Les réflexions faites en classe sont soumises chaque semaine sur Moodle et seront utilisées plus tard pour créer le rapport, ce qui permet à la fois d'observer son propre développement tout au long du semestre et de gagner du temps lors de la création du rapport à la fin du semestre.
Cadre théoriqueApprofondissement des aspects pratiques présentés au premier semestre, y compris les théories de l'apprentissage, de la facilitation, le développement des compétences pédagogiques pour aborder les problèmes complexes avec les étudiants de Bachelor.

Probabilistic proof systems (eg PCPs and IPs) have had a tremendous impact on theoretical computer science, as well as on real-world secure systems.
They underlie delegation of computation protocols and hardness of approximation.
This course covers the foundations of probabilistic proof systems.
Proofs are at the foundations of mathematics, and verifying the correctness of a mathematical proof is a fundamental computational task.
(The P versus NP problem, which deals precisely with the complexity of proof verification, is one of the most important open problems in all of mathematics.) The complexity-theoretic study of proof verification has led to new notions of mathematical proofs, such as Interactive Proofs, Probabilistically Checkable Proofs, and others.
Probabilistic proofs are a powerful tool for proving hardness of approximation results, and are an essential building block to achieve delegation of computation (protocols that enable super fast verification of long computations, such as SNARKs).
Via these applications, probabilistic proofs have had a tremendous impact on theoretical computer science and, more recently, are playing an exciting role in applied cryptography, computer security, and blockchain technology (e.g., they help secure billions of dollars in transactionds per day).
This course provides an introduction to probabilistic proofs and the beautiful mathematics underlying them.Covered topics include arithmetization, the sumcheck protocol, zero knowledge, doubly-efficient interactive proofs, linearity testing, low-degree testing, proof composition, succinct verification, and more.

This course introduces the principles, methods, and applications of foundation models and generative AI, i.e., two areas that increasingly shape the frontiers of machine learning.
Foundation models are large-scale models pretrained on broad and diverse data, capable of adapting to a wide range of downstream tasks across modalities.
While not all foundation models are generative, many leverage generative modeling techniques, such as autoregressive prediction, variational inference, diffusion processes, and flow-based transformations, to learn expressive representations and enable open-ended generation.
The course begins with the core generative model families, covering their objectives, mathematical foundations, and applications in language, vision, and scientific domains.
It then transitions to the design and scaling of foundation models, focusing on tokenization across modalities, architectural choices, and training strategies.
Students will explore multi-modal learning, prompting, adaptation (e.g.
fine-tuning, test-time training), and the role of reinforcement learning in aligning model behavior with desired outcomes.
Throughout, the course highlights how foundation models and generative AI increasingly intersect, particularly in the development of world models, where learned generative representations support simulation, planning, and decision-making.
Through lectures, assignments, and hands-on exercises, students will gain both theoretical and practical understanding of the foundations, capabilities, and frontiers of generative and foundation models, and their growing impact across scientific and engineering domains.

This course focuses on goal-directed design and interaction design, two subjects treated in depth in the Cooper book (see reference below).
To practice these two methods, we propose a design challenge, which is further divided into mini-projects evenly spaced throughout the semester.
Design methods for HCI What is HCI:
its aims and goals Design thinking Goal-directed Design Mental model and different types of users Qualitative research and user interviews User modeling:
persona and empathy diagram Scenarios, requirements and framework design Visual design Information Visualization design Basic prototyping methods for HCI Storyboarding Context scenario Interactive prototype Video prototype Human computer interaction evaluation methods Cognitive walkthrough Heuristic evaluation Evaluation with users
This course consists of two parts:
1) architecture of automation systems, hands-on lab 2) dependable systems and handling of faults and failures in real-time systems, including fault-tolerant computing Trends like digitalization and internet of things affect the way industrial plants are designed, deployed and operated.
Industrial Automation comprises the control, communication and software architecture in (real-time) automation systems:
factories, energy production and distribution, vehicles and other embedded systems.
As we move towards an AI economy, the success of new products, systems and services depend increasingly on the excellence of personal experience.
This course introduces students to the notion and practice of experience design following a hands-on, studio-based approach.
Experience design in practice encompasses the collection, analysis and design of users experiences based on a deep understanding of the context concerned.
We will examine these processes using a series of mini-workshops, to rapidly iterate on multiple design experience options.
The goal is to create a meaningful, interactive, data-driven (and possibly AI-assisted) digital interface and physical prototypes for new experiences.
We explore questions at the intersection of physical and digital architecture through an experience design approach, involving:
(1) a mapping of the social dynamics surrounding an experience;
(2) a critical analysis of the geographical and temporal flows (experience journeys);
and (3) a detailed evaluation of the experience touch points.
Based on this experience diagnosis, we propose alternative designs of experience blueprints that combine physical and digital touch points which in turn will constitute the elements of future typologies.
Our particular focus will be on information intensive typologies in the contemporary city, such as museums, libraries, airports, banks, boutiques, governments, universities, hospitals and homes.
Each year, we will investigate a different typology.
Digital interfaces and augmented artifacts will be considered as possible alternatives to reconfigure the senses of perception, redistribute time, and reorchestrate the configuration of social, emotional and spatial experiences.
The seminar will combine students from both IC and ENAC to work together in a real interdisciplinary process.
The course focuses on the development of real-word AI/ML products.
It is intended for students who have acquired a theoretical background in AI/ML and are interested in applying that toward developing AI/ML-oriented products.
AI is set to transform several industry sectors, and there is high demand for AI product managers.
AI Product Management (AIPM) is a complex role that requires an understanding of both AI and product management.
This course will enable students to identify opportunities for developing new AI products, understand when they should use AI in an existing product/process, manage the development of AI products, and launch AI products successfully.
The lectures will introduce general product management to the students, and the guest lectures, by leading figures in AI industries, explain how the general product management skills are applied to the development and delivery of AI products.

This course covers both classic concepts and recent advances in computer vision and machine learning for processing visual data -- with a primary focus on embodied intelligence and multimodal learning Visual perception is the capability of inferring the properties of the external world merely from the light reflected off the objects therein.
This is done beautifully well by simple (e.g., mosquitoes) or complex (e.g., humans) biological organisms.
They can see and understand the complex environment around them and act accordingly -- all done in an efficient and astonishingly robust way.
Computer vision is the discipline of replicating this capability for machines.
Despite a remarkable progress in the past few years, a large gap to sophisticated perceptual capabilities, such as those exhibited by animals, remains.
The goal of this course is to discuss what is possible in computer vision today and what is not.
We will overview the basic concepts in computer vision and recent advances in machine learning relevant to processing visual data, multimodal learning, and active perception.
For inspiration around the missing capabilities and how to approach them, we will turn to visual perception in biological organisms.
The course includes lectures, homeworks, and projects.
There will be a heavy emphasis on the projects and hands-on experience.
The homework tasks will focus on key tools and concepts in ML, including Transformers, LLMs, multimodal foundation models, and perceptual simulation environments The course project will be around designing, implementing, and testing a solution to a (preferably open) problem pertinent to visual perception.
The students are encouraged to work in groups, propose a project that interests them, and pursue ambitious yet feasible goals.
The course staff will provide support throughout the semester with the projects.
In the lectures, the students will learn about the principles of computer vision and multimodal learning, the current limits, and the visual perception in humans and animals, which will help them with formulating their course projects.
In particular, the lectures will discuss the following:
An overview of basic computer vision concepts:
classification, detection, grouping, image transformations, optical flow, 3D from X, etc., and recent neural network architectures, such as Transformers.
Psychology/physiology of the visual system.
Multimodal leanring and multimodal foundation models.

active perception and embodied vision.
The course interests masters/PhD students interested in research in computer vision, machine learning, and perceptual robotics, as well as senior undergraduate students interested in understanding state-of-the-art computer vision.
This advanced graduate course teaches the key design principles underlying successful computer and communication systems, and shows how to solve real problems with ideas, techniques, and algorithms from operating systems, networks, databases, programming languages, and computer architecture.
A modern computer system spans many layers:
applications, libraries, operating systems, networks, and hardware devices.
Building a good system entails making the right trade-offs (e.g., between performance, durability, and correctness) and understanding emergent behaviors.
Great system designers make these trade-offs in a principled fashion, whereas average ones make them by trial-and-error.
In this course, we develop a principled framework for computer system design, covering the following topics:
Modules and interfaces Names Layers Indirection and virtualization Redundancy and fault tolerance Client/server architectures Distributed systems Transactional building blocks

Over the past decade, supply chain management has drawn enormous attention by industry and academia alike.
Given an increasingly global economy, pronounced trends towards outsourcing and advances in information technology, more and more complex business relationships among companies have evolve When taken together with market pressures such as rapidly changing product life cycles, proliferation of product variety, and co-existence multiple distribution channels, supply chain management today is rightfully seen as a new competitive imperative.
While industry is making tremendous progress in experimenting with new and innovative ways to manage their supply chains, we are beginning to see widespread interests to better inform supply chain choices by careful analysis of impeded tradeoffs.
In this seminar, we will provide an overview of the state-of-the art in supply chain modeling and study select research papers on this topic.
We will draw on the understanding and experience of industrial practices to illustrate key tradeoffs.
The resulting mathematical models are used to foster managerial insights and prescribe optimal courses of actions.

The course aims at providing a comprehensive overview of ongoing advanced manufacturing research topics and an opportunity for students to investigate current research trends in one particular topic of their choice.
The core lectures will reflect the diversity of ongoing advanced manufacturing research at EPFL and will include selected topics in composites, metals, fibers, printing techniques, nano-scale fabrication, lasers-processing and stretchable electronics and interfaces.
Lecturers will mainly be from the EPFL's program on advanced manufacturing.
The course will start on Monday 27th October and end on 31st October 2025, not included self-study and preparation time.
The course format will be a lecture in the morning given by an expert in the field, followed by an afternoon session, where a team of students will present a topic they have selected for investigation and discussion in the class.
Finally, an invited speaker will be invited to give a special lecture to end the course.
Students will then explore the current research trends related to this topic, up to a point where they are able write an review report about it.
This report shall give a comprehensive and critical overview about the subject.
It will be presented during a two-hour session, where the participants of the class will discuss it and suggest improvements or amendments.
Once finalized, and so that this report becomes useful to a broader audience (beyond this class), the report will be added to an online Wikipedia-style repository about advanced manufacturing processes that will be gradually built as the course runs.
The presentation of the reports will be peer-reviewed by the students themselves (in addition to the evaluation by the professors) and the reports evaluated by the professors.

getting started, structure and argumentation, time management and self-motivation, getting and handling feedback, publications, and technical tools.
Doctoral Thesis Writing Workshop Writing a doctoral thesis is hard work.
It is hard for different reasons for different people, but it must be done, not only so that theses emerge into completeness - and hopefully also works of great quality - but also so that students can themselves graduate into competent professionals.The problem is that the skill sets graduate students have developed over their long years in school very often fail them during their last extended hurdle - the PhD thesis.
They can no longer think through their entire project before beginning it.
They can no longer write in a mad dash at the end.
There are few true deadlines and there is little support for modest advances.
On the technical side, it is difficult to make a multipart argument and students often struggle with how to limit data collection (especially in the era of the internet).
In general dissertation writing is slower, less satisfying, lonelier and the product often weaker than it has ever been.The Doctoral Thesis Writing Workshop is designed to guide students through the most common pitfalls of thesis writing.
It helps them learn a new set of skills far more appropriate to the task at hand:
from developing successful work habits to organizing and structuring the document as a whole.
The workshop focuses on practical, technical, and content related issues of dissertation writing and on the less technical, more emotional stumbling blocks that come with completing a big piece of work and a significant phase in students own career development.
The Workshop will run for two days The language of instruction will be English.
1) General Skills for the successful completions of a PhD Thesis will cover issues difficult for all dissertation writers, most specifically:- How to Set up and Stick to a daily writing regime- How to Separate Writing from Research- Tools for Writing before you Know what to Say- Tools for Limiting and Managing Data- How to Make an Argument- Editing Skills to Live By- Skills for Limiting and Managing Distractions- Learning to Rest.
The Dissertation Writing Workshop is designed for graduate students at any stage in the dissertation writing process - from not-a-word-written to full-draft-in-need-of-revisions-completed.
The workshop aims to support students in the writing of their PhD dissertation (whether in the form of a long manuscript or as a cumulative thesis).
It is designed to equip the participants with a series of practical tools that can make their thesis writing smoother and better organized.
It examines the various issues involved in writing a doctoral thesis:
getting started, structure and argumentation, time management and self-motivation, getting and handling feedback, publications, composing a thesis from articles, as well as providing technical tools that can help throughout the process.
The workshop is interactive and includes short lectures on key points, practical exercises, as well as question and discussion time.The main workshop language is English and the writing conventions we will refer to are those of the English speaking world.
However, participants writing in French are welcome to attend too, and comments in French are very welcome throughout the workshop.The registered participants are required to hand in a 5-6 page text (in relation to their thesis) and a little questionnaire until a week before the workshop.
The text should ideally be a draft text written by the participant alone, and should be reasonably understandable also by non specialists of their specific area of interest (it could be a proposal, a portion of an introduction or a section of a data analysis chapter).
Le séminaire international a pour vocation d'explorer la notion de « rythme » comme grille de lecture des mondes contemporains, mode de représentation et de transformation actif par la pratique voire paradigme nouveau.
Le séminaire international a pour vocation d'explorer la notion de "rythme" comme grille de lecture des mondes contemporains, mode de représentation et de transformation actif par la pratique voire paradigme nouveau (Michon, 2013).
Le concept de "rythme" au sens de "rhuthmos" ne se limite pas à la définition platonicienne "d'ordre du mouvement" mais s'élargit à "manière de fluer" (Benveniste, 1974), "configurations particulières du mouvant", une sorte de forme de l'instant qui n'aurait pas de conception organique, un arrangement spatio-temporel, un "chronotope".
Il ouvre à l'éprouver, à l'expérience, aux sens, à la présence, à la "corporéité" et à "l'exister" "avoir sa tenue hors de soi, dans l'ouverture" (Maldiney, 2007).
Il permet d'aborder nombre de mobilisations politiques, d'expériences ou de performances artistiques en termes de "communautés d'expérience" (Dewey, 1980) et de "politique de l'événement, un désir d'agir avec les autres pour ouvrir le champ du possible et interrompre la répétition immuable du temps et de la servitude" (Dollé, 2005).
Objectifs du séminaire :
- Participer à une réflextion interdisciplinaire avec des partenaires, chercheurs et praticiens internationaux sur l'approche des rythmes, notion importante dans un contexte de crise sanitaire.
- Associer des doctorants à une réflexion dans un contexte international.
- Participer à une dynamique de recherche en émergence sur les rythmes avec celles et ceux qui y contribuent.
- Favoriser l'acquisition de méthodologies de recherche sur la question dans différents cadres disciplinaires.
- Favoriser l'intégration des doctorants dans le contexte de la recherche en facilitant les échanges directs avec des chercheurs et praticiens confirmés.

INVITES :
Isabelle Bey (Météosuisse), Emilie Nault (CSD Ingénieurs), Clément Gaillard (Freio design climatique), Vincent Kempf (Ville de Sion - EspaceSuisse), Olivier Philippe (agenceter), Tim Cousin (roofscapes), Philippe Rahm (Philippe Rahm architectes), Emmanuel Rey (LAST | Bauart) Malgré tous les efforts entrepris depuis le début du siècle pour limiter les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, force est de constater que leur inflexion à l'échelle mondiale se fait malheureusement toujours attendre.
Au défi de la protection du climat s'ajoute ainsi dorénavant celui de l'adaptation de nos cadres de vie aux conséquences de son dérèglement.
Accueillant la majorité des habitants et emplois, les villes et agglomérations sont en première ligne de cette transformation, d'autant plus qu'en raison de l'effet d'îlot de chaleur urbain, elles se réchauffent davantage que les campagnes environnantes.
L'analyse des villes actuelles montre qu'elles ne sont pas vraiment adaptées au réchauffement climatique attendu.
Sans une série d'actions rapides, significatives et convergentes, leur habitabilité pourrait être partiellement remise en cause à moyen terme.
Face à cette évolution à l'ampleur incertaine, de multiples mesures d'adaptation sont déjà clairement identifiées pour agir favorablement sur les espaces bâtis, publics et paysagers.
L'acclimatation low-tech des bâtiments, la déminéralisation des revêtements urbains, le renforcement des maillages fertiles, la préservation des corridors d'air frais, l'arborisation des espaces publics ou l'augmentation significative de la canopée urbaine sont autant de pistes concrètes permettant d'anticiper de manière ambitieuse et créative ces enjeux devenus incontournables.
Le cours s'inscrit dans la dynamique du Forum des transitons urbaines qui se déroulera sur une journée entière, la participation à ce dernier faisant partie intégrante du cours.
Les interventions de la première partie de la journée aborderont des approches thématiques tandis que celles de la seconde partie de la journée présenteront des démarches exemplaires.
Grâce à la diversité des recherches et des exemples présentés lors de l'événement, le cours permettra également aux participantes et participants de rencontrer des actrices et acteurs de la pratique, de l'enseignement, de la recherche, de la politique ou des services publics intéressés à la notion de qualité du milieu urbain et aux transitions en cours dans les territoires urbains.
Lors de son inscription, chaque participante et participant se voit fournir par les organisateurs une liste de lectures préalables.
Ces lectures devront avoir été réalisées en tant que préparation au Forum.
Quatre semaines après le cours, chaque participante et participant remet un texte synthétique sous forme de rapport succinct portant sur les enjeux d'une transition vers des villes bioclimatiques en se basant sur les lectures préalables et les interventions du Forum.
Le travail est individuel.
This doctoral seminar expands the concept of 'the field' beyond traditional boundaries to encompass diverse fieldwork methodologies - from ethnographic observation to laboratory research to archival investigation - examining the ethics, challenges, and opportunities each presents.
In this seminar, Field Work, established scholars and emerging researchers will share their experiences of navigating various research terrains.
Each guest will walk participants through their specific fieldwork journey, revealing the behind-the-scenes realities of how they gained access, built relationships, and adapted their methods in response to unexpected circumstances.
Working groups of peer-to-peer discussion will allow for exchange and enriching conversations.
Drawing on feminist science studies (Haraway's situated knowledge), we propose that the boundaries between "field", "lab", and "archive" are more porous than traditionally acknowledged.
Each space involves distinct forms of embodiment and power relations that shape knowledge production.
This seminar will span two days, and explore these three fields:
-The Terrain:
Focusing on traditional and contemporary approaches to ground-based fieldwork in built environment research, with particular attention to questions of positionality and situated knowledge, this session will examine how researchers' social positions, identities, and embodied experiences shape their understanding of field sites and communities.
Guests will share experiences of conducting ethnographic observation, interviews, and participatory research while critically reflecting on their own positionality within power structures and knowledge production processes.
We will discuss methodologies that acknowledge the partial, located nature of all knowledge claims, exploring how researchers can be accountable for their perspectives rather than claiming false objectivity.
The session will address the ethics of community engagement, risks of social extraction, strategies for building reciprocal relationships with research participants, and approaches that center community knowledge and agency.
-The Lab:
Addressing controlled research environments and experimental methodologies in built environment studies - While the humanities have developed robust fieldwork practices, technical disciplines related to the built environment often operate within laboratory settings that require distinct methodological approaches.
This session will explore how researchers navigate institutional lab spaces, manage equipment and protocols, and collaborate across disciplinary boundaries.
Guests will discuss the politics and ethics of lab-based research, including questions of access, funding, and the translation of controlled experiments into real-world applications.
-The Archive:
Investigating strategies for navigating institutional archives, personal collections, and digital repositories in built environment research.
Often housed in architectural firms, municipal offices, historical societies, and private collections, the documentary evidence of built environment practices requires specialized access strategies and interpretive skills.
This session will discuss how researchers locate relevant archives, negotiate access with gatekeepers, and develop systematic approaches to document analysis.
Beyond physical archives, we will explore digital repositories, oral history collections, and emerging forms of documentation including social media and crowd-sourced platforms.
Each of the three sessions will be organized as a roundtable discussion, including doctoral students, masters students, EPFL scholars and researchers, and external guests, providing a platform for critical reflection, dialogue, and collaboration on navigating the complexities of fieldwork across diverse research environments.
Attendees will gain insights into emerging trends, challenges, and opportunities in contemporary field research, as well as practical strategies for conducting ethical, rigorous, and impactful research across terrain, lab, and archive.
The seminar will take place in November, in the context of the RIOT Lab project Material Strategies:
Biobased Insulation and Reused Timber Towards a Decarbonized Construction Sector.
This workshop invites three leading architecture historians - Prof.
Alla Vronskaya, Prof.
Zeynep Çelik Alexander, and Prof.

Cristobal Amunátegui This workshop invites three leading scholars of architectural history - Prof.
Alla Vronskaya, Prof.
Zeynep Çelik Alexander, and Prof.
Cristóbal Amunátegui - to present and discuss their work on the intersections between architecture and numerical regimes since the nineteenth century.
As we learn from mid-twentieth-century anthropologists, counting is always rooted in material practices, from body techniques such as finger counting, to objectification of numbering with devices such as khipu, abacus, or ledgers.
With the rise of liberal societies in the mid-eighteenth century, new regimes of calculation emerged to tame the growing social and economic uncertainties that followed the toppling of older political and productive orders.
While histories of probability, statistics, and accounting have long addressed for the ways risk began to be managed via quantification, the material and spatial dimensions of this process have received comparatively less attention.
Joining a host of new architectural histories concerned with these developments, we aim to bring together scholarship that grounds numbers in material and spatial practices.
The course guests will present their ongoing research on histories of risk management, statistics, probability, accounting, and other such actuarial practices.
Special attention will be paid to the objects of these bureaucracies, ranging from paper data sets to buildings housing counting offices and infrastructures designed to store and quantify materials and commodities.
Similarly, the discussions will aim at identifying the hierarchies and resistances embedded in the history of these architectures of counting.
This workshop welcomes doctoral students in the history of architecture working on the long modern period, ranging from 1750 to 1950, with any geographic focus, whether at the center or periphery of the commercial and administrative empires that emerged during this two-hundred-years historical arc.
Students are expected to attend the lectures by the guests and complete the reading assignments in advance.
They will also be expected to participate actively in the reading discussions.
This workshop is offered by the SNSF-founded project "Data Centers:
An Environmental History of Information" lead by Alfredo Thiermann, Xavier Nueno, and Pedro Correa.

To expose EDBB students to research in Bioengineering through attendance of lecture series given by EDBB students and external speakers.
The objectives are to broaden the knowledge of students in the field of Bioengineering and expose them to the diversity of studies in the IBI community.
This cross-disciplinary, seminar-based course will increase EDBB students' exposure to a broad range of fields of research and reinforce interactions within the Institute of Bioengineering (IBI) at the intersection between the School of Life Sciences and the School of Engineering.
The course comprises a series of seminars along the academic year in various fields of Bioengineering given either by EDBB students in the final years of their PhD and external speakers.
Seminars will include an introduction of the research field in order to be understandable despite the diversity of covered topics, and will aim to foster general discussions.
This course will therefore serve as an extended journal-club involving the large community of EDBB students.

Biology is becoming more and more a data science, as illustrated by the explosion of available genome sequences.
This course aims to show how we can make sense of such data and harness it in order to understand biological processes in a quantitative way.
Recently, biology has become more and more a data science.
For instance, progress in sequencing has caused an explosion of available genome sequences.
How can we make sense of such data and harness it in order to understand biological processes in a quantitative way?
In many cases, biological data can be understood as being sampled from distributions of random variables.

This course shows students how the physical principles of conservation, symmetry, and locality influence the dynamics of living organisms at the molecular and cellular level.
Computer simulations are used to explore examples of cellular dynamics and phase transitions.
Learning outcomes:
Justify selected molecular simulation techniques a for simulating cellular processes;
solve simplified dynamical models relevant to a cell;
explain how symmery affects cellular dynamics This course aims to show how the principles of symmetry and conservation are used by a cell in carrying out its functions.
We will examine selected cellular structures and dynamical processes and construct computational models of them that are solved analytically, numerically or with computer simulations.
The importance of dimensionality is illustrated by examining random walks in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions and two-dimensional fluid membranes that surround many cellular organelles and form the plasma membrane.
The symmetry of a system usually changes when passing through a phase transition, and it is increasingly accepted that cells manipulate the phase behaviour of intrinsically-disordered proteins in the cytoplasm to create membraneless organelles.
These organelles, which are also referred to as biomolecular condensates, carry out vital functions for the cell, but are also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
They are three-dimensional, fluid networks formed by a process of liquid-liquid phase separation, and exhibit quite distinct structures and dynamics that are controlled by the thermodynamic properties of their constituent proteins within the crowded environment of the cytosol.
We will construct models of IDPs and use simulations to quantitatively connect the structural properties of IDPs to the physical chemical properties of the condensates.
Computer simulations are used to explore model systems in homework problems and a semester project.
The primary goal of the course is to show students how nature uses symmetry and conservation to achieve specific cellular goals, and to understand how computer simulations can be used to study these processes.

In parallel, the students will embark on a semester-long project, split in agile teams of 3-4 students.
In the project, students propose and execute meaningful analyses of a real-world dataset, which will require creativity and the application of the tools encountered in the course.
The outcome of this team effort will be a project portfolio that will be made public (and available as open source).
At the end of the semester, students will take a 3-hour final exam in a classroom with their own computer, where they will be asked to complete a data analysis pipeline (both with code and extensive comments) on a dataset they have never worked with before.
Natural language processing is ubiquitous in modern intelligent technologies, serving as a foundation for language translators, virtual assistants, search engines, and many more.

This course covers both classic concepts and recent advances in computer vision and machine learning for processing visual data -- with a primary focus on embodied intelligence and multimodal learning Visual perception is the capability of inferring the properties of the external world merely from the light reflected off the objects therein.
This is done beautifully well by simple (e.g., mosquitoes) or complex (e.g., humans) biological organisms.
They can see and understand the complex environment around them and act accordingly -- all done in an efficient and astonishingly robust way.
Computer vision is the discipline of replicating this capability for machines.
Despite a remarkable progress in the past few years, a large gap to sophisticated perceptual capabilities, such as those exhibited by animals, remains.
The goal of this course is to discuss what is possible in computer vision today and what is not.
We will overview the basic concepts in computer vision and recent advances in machine learning relevant to processing visual data, multimodal learning, and active perception.
For inspiration around the missing capabilities and how to approach them, we will turn to visual perception in biological organisms.
The course includes lectures, homeworks, and projects.
There will be a heavy emphasis on the projects and hands-on experience.
The homework tasks will focus on key tools and concepts in ML, including Transformers, LLMs, multimodal foundation models, and perceptual simulation environments The course project will be around designing, implementing, and testing a solution to a (preferably open) problem pertinent to visual perception.
The students are encouraged to work in groups, propose a project that interests them, and pursue ambitious yet feasible goals.
The course staff will provide support throughout the semester with the projects.
In the lectures, the students will learn about the principles of computer vision and multimodal learning, the current limits, and the visual perception in humans and animals, which will help them with formulating their course projects.
In particular, the lectures will discuss the following:
An overview of basic computer vision concepts:
classification, detection, grouping, image transformations, optical flow, 3D from X, etc., and recent neural network architectures, such as Transformers.
Psychology/physiology of the visual system.

The modern techniques and methods to measure snow properties in the field and in the laboratory are introduced by specialists in the corresponding field.
The methods are applied in the field and in the laboratory and a report prepared using the measured data.
ObjectivesThe cryosphere forms an integral part of the climate system of the Earth.
Measuring the properties of the seasonal and perennial snow cover properties is therefore essential in understanding interactions and feedback mechanisms related to the cryosphere.
Snow is an extremely complex and highly variable medium, and all essential properties of seasonal snow cover are challenging to measure.
Diverse fields such as hydrology, climatology, avalanche forecasting and Earth Observation from space benefit from improved quantification of snow cover properties, in particular related to the snow microstructure.
The past 10 years snow science has seen a rapid change from a semi-quantitative to a quantitative science.
Understanding physical and chemical processes in the snowpack requires detailed measurements of the microstructure.
The Snow Science Winter School will teach these advanced techniques, as micro-tomography, measurement of specific surface area by reflection and spectroscopy, near-infrared photography and high-resolution penetrometry.
The course in 2020 takes place at Col du Lautaret, France, in the premises of the ¿Station Alpine Joseph Fourier¿.
Target audienceAny graduate student or post-doc working on snow or in some snow related field is welcome to participate.
Those fields include Glaciology, Hydrology, Oceanography, Geography, but also Biology or Chemistry as well as Engineering or Material Sciences.
Course structure The focus of this workshop lies on field and laboratory measurements, combined with theoretical lessons in the classroom.
Obligatory reading is provided about one month before the workshop, and will be examined during the school.
Field and laboratory measurements will be done in small groups of 3-4 students.
Each group of students will have to prepare a report describing the methods, results and interpretation of the measured data after the course.
For details and application see:
http://www.slf.ch/more/snowschool Learning outcomes By the end of the course, the student must be able to:
Measure snow properties using modern methods and able to choose the correctmethod
The participants will reflect on their own scientific work with respect to other disciplinary methods and discuss possible benefits of interdisciplinary approach in their field.
Moreover, students will further be able to learn the advanced methods used in the broad forestry field.
ObjectivesForests play a vital role in our planet's health, providing numerous benefits and services to both humans and the environment.
However, forests face various risks, particularly from extreme events, which can have significant impacts on their health and functioning.
The risks associated with extreme events include forest fires that can cause widespread damage to wildlife habitats and vegetation, storms and wind damages that disrupt ecological processes and alter the forest structure, insect outbreaks and diseases, which causes widespread tree mortality, and global-change type droughts that disrupt the species composition and overall forest health.
Mitigating these risks requires proactive forest management practices, early detection of pests and diseases, reforestation efforts and the development of climate-resilient forests.
The goal of the summer school "Forests in the Anthropocene", jointly organized with WSL and the Swiss Forest Lab, is to provide a holistic view on the risks and challenges forests will face in the future along with the solutions that can be implemented to mitigate them.
The course will address different angles, including environmental issues and ecological concepts, as well as socio-economic and policy frameworks.
The participants will reflect on their own scientific work with respect to other disciplinary methods and discuss possible benefits of interdisciplinary approach in their field.
Moreover, students will further be able to learn the advanced methods used in the field.
The course in 2024 takes place in Davos, Switzerland.
Target audienceThe Summer School is open to PhD students and PostDocs in forestry research and related disciplines.
Course structureThe summer school will combine lectures by invited guests from EPFL, ETH and WSL, and field measurements.
PhD students will be asked to give a presentation about their work or a poster to be presented during multiple poster sessions during the week.
Several excursions will be planned as well as networking events and stakeholder dialogue.

This course introduces the modern theoretical tools that underpin the understanding of solid-liquid interfaces and fluid flows through nanometer-scale openings.
The few nanometers where a solid ends and a liquid begins determine the large-scale behavior of many industrially-relevant systems, such as filtration membranes, electrochemical cells and supercapacitors.
Nanofluidics is also a frontier for fundamental research, where the continuum of fluid dynamics meets the atomic and even the quantum nature of matter.
This course introduces the modern theoretical tools that underpin the understanding of solid-liquid interfaces and fluid flows through nanometer-scale openings.
In the first part, we will review the foundations of electrolyte theory and show how the interplay of the various electrostatic lengthscales can be used to tune nanofluidic transport.
In the second part, will explore the limits of continuum theory and introduce some of the tools that can tackle sub-continuum, non-linear and quantum effects.
The overall aim of the course is to give students an intuition for the solid-liquid systems that they may encounter across various areas of chemistry and physics.

We will cover key concepts of Medicinal Chemistry, from identification of active chemical starting points to how they are optimized to deliver drug candidates.
We will use real case studies from the pharmaceutical industry.
Students will design compounds to solve Medicinal Chemistry problems.
The course will focus on the science of Medicinal Chemistry which aims to identify small molecules to treat human disease.
We will cover the different phases of drug discovery.
Starting from how to identify a starting point with activity on a target, we will then discuss how to optimize it towards a drug candidate.
A small molecule needs to have many properties to become a drug.
To name a few:
it needs to bind to a target to elicit a biological effect;
when taken as a pill it needs to be absorbed and reach the diseased tissue to have a therapeutic effect;
it also needs to be safe for the patient...
This means the medicinal chemist needs to optimize a wide range of properties to get to a drug candidate and importantly understand the relationship between the chemical structure and its properties.
These concepts will be introduced together with real case studies from the pharmaceutical industry.
Students will also work on common problems that medicinal chemists face and will have the opportunity to design compounds with the aim to improve properties of a molecule.
The expectation is that this course will give students the basic knowledge that is needed to be an effective medicinal chemist at the start of their career.

introduction to the main experimental characterization techniques (I-V curve, PLQY, PL spectra, TRPL, XRD, NMR).
Emphasis will be placed on how to use this information to set up meaningful simulation protocols.
Simulation of PSC devices:
students will become familiar with different quantum (CP2K, Quantum Espresso, Gaussian) and classical (LAMMPS, AMBER) simulation software applied to perovskites, different hole transport layers (HTL) and electron transport layers (ETL), also in the case of interaction with passivating molecules.
The modeling of perovskite/ETL(HTL) interfaces in the presence/absence of additives will also be addressed.
Particular attention will be paid to the simulation of optoelectronic properties (band gaps, band alignment, exciton binding energy, etc.) in the presence/absence of additives.
Force field development:
in most cases, the size of the system and/or the physical-chemical mechanisms investigated require a number of atoms and/or timescales that can only be achieved with classical MD.
In this case, it is essential to have accurate force fields based on ab initio simulations to be sure of correctly capturing all interactions of the system.
Students will learn the basic concepts of force field development (including machine learning interatomic potentials) from ab initio data.
They will also learn how to parameterize force fields in the presence of composite systems, such as additives and perovskites.

This course will introduce students to the central topics in digital musicology and core theoretical approaches and methods.
In the practical part, students will carry out a practical project.
Digital Musicology (DM) is a vibrant field which studies music, its properties and its development across genres, times, historical traditions and cultures.
The digital humanities revolution with its data-driven methods has initiated a paradigmatic shift in musicology, making it possible to tap into musical corpora of unprecedented size and often reveal new kinds of evidence.
Since music is in essence a phenomenon of the human mind, the field combines methods from music theory, psychology, data science and computational modeling.
This class will offer an introduction into DM, its central questions, methods and the state-of-the-art.
It will put a particular focus on symbolic music and its processing.
The course is structured around the core parameters of music and surveys some of the main ways of exploring them theoretically, cognitively and computationally.
The class will be complemented with a practical project that students will carry out.
Course topics include:
Core research questions in DM Musical corpora, representation, and transmission Psychoacoustic foundations Rhythm, meter, expressive timing, groove Tuning, scales and modes Models of tonal pitch, tonal space, models of tonality Melodic shape and structure Musical expectancy and predictive processing Combining notes and polyphony Chords and harmony Musical form and musical grammar Cultures, histories, geographies and networks Music aesthetics and philosophy
This course will engage novel approaches for visualizing and interacting with cultural heritage archives in immersive virtual environments.
Today we mine data:
tomorrow we will sculpt it * Cultural Data Sculpting is at the intersection of two dynamic phenomena, the ever-expanding heterogeneous digital archives, in conjunction with their visualization in immersive, interactive display systems.
This course will engage novel approaches (with computational challenges) to create innovative applications for visualizing and interacting with these cultural heritage archives.
This course is located at a laboratory researching the forefront of experimentation in galleries, libraries, archives and museums, The Laboratory for Experimental Museology (eM+).
This lab contains large scale immersive, interactive virtual reality and augmented reality systems including a 360-degree 3D panoramic projection screen, a 4K fulldome and a 12m long linear navigation system.
Students will have access to already existing digital cultural archives including structured and unstructured data, 3D and 2D multimedia materials.
Students will work together in small teams to analyze and gain a deep understanding of the archive.
They will then design an interactive and immersive installation on one of eM+ systems to navigate their chosen archive, and implement small prototypes presenting specific aspects of their project.
It is important that students attend the theoretical lectures to gain full benefit, and actively participate in the hands-on sessions to properly advance on their projects.

This course introduces the core concepts and methodologies of Digital Humanities, integrating both theoretical and practical perspectives.
Students learn to work with large-scale cultural datasets, acquiring the tools and techniques required for their processing, analysis, and interpretation.
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of Digital Humanities, combining both theoretical and applied perspectives.
It offers a comprehensive overview of how large-scale cultural datasets are processed, analysed, and modelled.
The course is structured in three parts:
Part I:
Pipelines introduces technical workflows for digitising and modelling cultural materials such as written documents (printed and handwritten), photographs of artworks, maps, and 3D models.
Part II:
Algorithms presents key algorithmic approaches used in Digital Humanities, encompassing both symbolic methods (Semantic Web, constraint-based reasoning) and subsymbolic methods (deep learning, large language models).
Part III:
Platform Management examines the infrastructure and governance of cultural data platforms, including the management of data, users, and autonomous agents.
Ethical and societal implications are addressed throughout the course.
Students gain hands-on experience by working directly with cultural datasets from large-scale research projects currently conducted at EPFL.
How can we turn digital technologies and data into meaningful user experiences?
How can we face societal issues raised by digital evolution?
This course proposes an immersion in design research, user centered creativity and UX/UI psychology, through project based learning.
Warning:
the first three weeks are instrumental to perform the project, as they provide specific tools and the core theoretical background.
Well before the digital age, design has shown its impact on the relation between technology and society.
A short travel in time helps to better understand today's digital innovation challenges:
Bauhaus, Functionalism, Postmodernism, Radical Design, Hippie Modernism...
We'll then look more closely at design research and associated concepts, such as inclusive design, design thinking, design sprint, speculative design or design fiction.
A specific focus on contemporary methodologies of design research will show principles to combine artistic and scientific approaches.
With a major objective:
undertand how we can generate innovation with sustainable impact.
User experience and observation will be addressed from complementary point of views:
on the one hand, psychology, providing scientific experimental tools and theoretical references.
On the other hand, design practices, based on empathy and anthropology, to enhance inspiration in the creative process.
Several case studies will enlight the signification of the different theories, methodologies and practices.
Design researchers from EPFL+ECAL Lab will unveil insights on recent and ongoing projects:
hypothesis, experiences, results, but also unexpected outcomes, difficulties and learnings.
In parallel, the students will work in small groups on an applied project, based on a real ongoing research at the EPFL+ECAL lab.
The work aims to put in practice some of the theoretical aspects, as well as to experiment tools for field observation and prototyping.
The course will put a special emphasis on each participant's creativity, ability to take in account end users, and hands on design work.
The course presents a number of computational approaches & tools that can be used to study history.
Drawing on case studies from the history of science & technology, the course also offers students the opportunity to critically reflect on their own practices as digital humanists and data scientists.
The development of information technologies and the rise of the digital humanities have opened new, exciting avenues for historical research and for the engagement of historians with the public.
History and the digital have intersected in ways that, first, reconfigure historical research through the extensive digitization of sources and the creation of computational tools to process historical data ("digital history");
second, offer a wealth of new objects for historical research ("historicizing the digital").
Accordingly, the course proposes not only to survey the main computational approaches and methods that can be used to study history, but also, drawing on a series of case studies from the history of science and technology, to critically reflect on what it means to think digitally.
Students will develop small-group projects in digital history and will document their research in a final paper.

The course provides a comprehensive overview of methods, algorithms, and computer tools used in bioimage analysis.
It exposes fundamental concepts and practical computer solutions to extract quantitative information from multidimensional images, both using engineering methods and deep learning.
To investigate biological processes, bioimage informatics emerges as a growing field on the interface between microscopy, signal-processing, and computer science.
The recent microscopes are producing large volumes of high-resolution multidimensional data (up to 5D).
Therefore, algorithms and software tools are needed to automatically extract quantitative data from these images.
The course gives the theoretical concepts and practical aspects of the most common image reconstruction and image analysis techniques.
It explains how to code algorithms and to deploy software tools to build an automatic analysis workflow using the most common used software, Fiji/ImageJ (Java-based) and Jupyter Notebook (Python-based).
The lecture is tailored to the needs of life sciences and driven by biological questions.
Addressed topics include (but not restricted to):
presentation of microscopy modalities, digital images, multi-dimensional data (3D, time, multiple channels) manipulation, 3D image-processing algorithms, 5D visualization, image metrics, reconstruction, deconvolution, denoising, stitching, visual feature detection, segmentation, active contours, image analysis workflow, pixel classification, machine learning, deep learning for image analysis, large datasets, tracking of particles, and super-resolution localization microscopy.

The course will cover different aspects of multimodal processing (complementarity vs redundancy;
alignment and synchrony;
fusion), with an emphasis on the analysis of people, behaviors and interactions from multimodal sensor, using statistical models and deep learning as main modeling tools.
Multimodal processing is at the core of the perception of our world:
we see, we hear, we touch, we smell, we taste, and we move.
Being able to analyze and combine multimodal streams of data is therefore an inherent ability that should be addressed by artificial intelligence systems, and comprises several core challenges like how to represent multimodal information?
How to deal with modality asynchrony?
How to fuse complementary or redundant information?
How to do Co-training of models?
The course will cover this topic, with a particular emphasis on the analysis of people and of their behaviors, including interactions, from multimodal sensor streams (with a bias towards vision and audio).

The main sources of power consumption, the limitations and properties of different technologies, and the key techniques for reducing power consumption and improving energy efficiency will be identified.
Based on this understanding, the trade-offs and key issues involved in the selection and design of a suitable low power autonomous wireless link will be highlighted.
On the system side, we will cover the design aspects that often precede the actual design process, leading from the ideas and requirements to an initial system specification and block diagram.
We illustrate how decisions made at this point can have a tremendous impact on the efficiency of the final design due to the significant degrees of freedom available at this early stage of the design process.
In this regard, we will discuss the important tradeoffs that can be considered for example in terms of how a certain functionality is realized and which components are most appropriate for the task at hand.
We will base our discussion on the different components described in more detail throughout the course and we will illustrate the available tradeoffs with corresponding case studies.
At the end of the course, the participants will have gained knowledge on the state of the art and research trends in the field of energy autonomous wireless systems.

Overview of imaging modalities treated in thiscourse
This course covers the statistical physics approach to computer science problems, with an emphasis on heuristic & rigorous mathematical technics, ranging from graph theory and constraint satisfaction to inference to machine learning, neural networks and statitics.
Powerful Mathematical techniques from statistical physics and spin glass theory have been applied with increasing success on various problems ranging from computer science, statistics to machine learning.
In the last decades, in particular, there has been increasing convergence of interest and methods between theoretical physics and much theoretical and applied work in statistical physics and computer science has relied on the use of message-passing algorithms and their connection to the statistical physics of glasses and spin glasses.This course will cover this rich and active interdisciplinary research landscape.
A particular emphasis will be given to high-dimensional problems.
Indeed modern data analysis uses complex statistical models with massive numbers of parameters In some cases, the high-dimensional limit is analogous to the "thermodynamic limit" of a certain (disordered) statistical mechanics system.
Building on mathematical ideas from the mean-field theory of disordered systems, exact asymptotic can thus be computed for high-dimensional problems.
We shall discuss examples in statistics, coding theory, and machine learning.
While the course is designed to be a follow up of PHYS-512, it is also intendeded to stand on its own, and to be accessible to mathematically-minded graduate students and researchers from engineering, computer science and mathematics disciplines with a knowledge of probability and analysis.
The course is aimed at theory-minded students, interested in the use of powerful methods originating in statistical physics, and their connection to open problems in modern high-dimensional statistics, computer science and machine learning.
The main goal of this course is to give the student a solid introduction into approaches, methods, and instrumentation used in biomedical research.

This means that we will learn how to test asset pricing models and apply them mostly to stock markets.
We will see which theories fare well and which ones do not.
We will also learn about the cross-sectional patterns in stock returns.
Lately, there is enhanced understanding amongst finance scholars of the dangers of data mining and we will review techniques to guard against too many empirical regularities.
The flip side of the coin will be when we apply machine learning to discover even more patterns in the data (the class will not deal with techniques of machine learning;
only their applications).
Towards, the end we will move away from stocks to look at the cross-section of bonds and options and explore inter-linkages between these markets.
Finally, we will explore the performance of various kinds of funds.
Concretely, we will cover the following topics:
Asset pricing tests Cross-section of stock returns GMM/SDF based tests, choosing factors Aggregate predictability, test of conditional models Consumption-based models Multiple hypothesis testing Machine learning Stocks and corporate bonds Stocks and options Performance of mutual funds, institutional funds, hedge funds

This class is an introduction to Machine Learning and High Dimensional Statistics in Finance.
We start with purely empirical approach, focusing first on high dimensional regressions and the ideas of over-parametrization and over-fitting.
We then discuss the role of non-linearities, inductive biases, and ways to think and model non-linear structures in financial markets and economic systems.
We then move to kernel methods and deep learning, and then investigate equilibrium models in economies populated agents that are aware of the statistical complexity on the underlying systems:
The fact that we do not have enough observations to make efficient inference.
We show how "complexity corrections" emerge in every single statistical test and every single economic model, and that these corrections have first order effects on equilibrium dynamics.
Studying such complex models requires a new form of calculus:
Just like Ito calculus is necessary to study models in continuous time, this new calculus is necessary to study models with a lot of variables / shocks and lot of non-linearities.
Here is list of topics we will cover:
- Understand and apply modern methods for big data models with many predictors and factors.- Understand and apply big data models and neural networks, and the role of complexity corrections and limits to learning.- Construct high-dimensional factor models for the cross-section of returns and economic time series and develop an efficient, theory-based way of optimally incorporating high-dimensional information into portfolio construction and economic factor analysis.- Understand how to develop equilibrium models in the presence of statistical complexity.- Understand the role of trading costs, price impact, and the nature of shock propagation in economic systems through the lens of machine learning

This seminar course covers principles and recent advancements in machine learning methods that have the ability to solve multiple tasks and generalize to new domains in which training and test distributions are different.
While machine learning methods excel on tasks with large labeled datasets that can support learning of highly parameterized deep learning models, to solve real-world problems we need machine learning methods that can generalize to unseen domains and tasks.
The goal of this seminar course is to cover principles and recent advancements in machine learning methods that have the ability to solve multiple tasks and generalize to new domains in which training and test distributions are different.
This includes:- few-shot learning where the goal is to generalize to a new domain given only a few labeled examples- meta-learning methods that acquire prior knowledge over previous tasks so that new tasks can be efficiently solved - domain adaptation and domain generalization where the problem is to generalize to a given target domain given existing training source domain(s) where target and source datasets are generated from different distributions- zero-shot learning/open-world learning where the goal is to generalize to new unseen classes - self-supervised pretraining for cross-domain transfer Students will be expected to read, review, present, and discuss relevant research papers in this area.

The students will read, review and present papers from recent venues across the systems for ML spectrum.
The course will cover recent papers from the literature in the emerging area of ML systems.
With abundance of data and the emergence ofdata science, machine learning is widely applicable in a variety of usage scenrios with high performance, accuracy and cost being keydesign goals.
The latter not only has implications for algorithms but also platforms from software to hardware to enable collectiveoptimization of the design metrics.
The topic is inherently multidisciplinary and will cover papers from a variety of conferences in computerscience subfields;
e.g., ICML, NIPS, ICLR, KDD, VLDB, SIGMOD, SOSP, OSDI, SysML, ASPLOS and ISCA).

In this course students learn to read, understand, critique and present research papers.
Data collected through digital systems, such as online social networks, search engines, mobile phones, apps, etc., offer great opportunities for addressing important research questions about individual as well as collective human behavior.
Whereas such issues had previously been studied primarily by social scientists, the sheer size of modern social data sets, as well as the fact that they are produced within computational systems, requires computational ways of thinking about, and processing, them.
Moreover, such data is often messy and confounded, as it is collected from the real world taking its natural course, rather than under clean experimental conditions.
This makes it challenging to draw valid conclusions about cause and effect from such data, unless one proceeds carefully.
The goal of this seminar is to acquaint students with some of the fundamental questions and techniques arising in the context of computational social science, with a focus on research design and causal inference from messy data.
We will explore the above topics simultaneously in two ways:
We will read a textbook on causal inference for social science (most likely "Causal Inference:
The Mixtape" by Scott Cunningham, available online for free).
We will read research papers from computational social science that provide a deep dive into the topics discussed in the book.
Every week, we will focus on one portion of the book or on a research paper where the previous week's book materials are applied in practice.
All students will write a short summary and review of the respective materials, and one student will lead an in-class discussion.
Beyond familiarizing themselves with the methods and research questions in the field, students will become better at assessing and critiquing scholarly work (by discussing and reviewing papers).
Through this course, students will obtain an overview of the research designs and methods used in computational social science, and will encounter a series of papers based on them.
Moreover, they will increase their ability to summarize and critique scientific papers.

Original research articles have to be presented and critically reviewed.
The students will learn how to structure a scientific presentation in English.
An important goal of the seminar presentation is to summarize the essential ideas of a research paper in sufficient depth while omitting details which are not essential for the understanding of the work, as well as to identify strengths and weaknesses of the paper at hand, that is to demonstrate critical interaction with the presented material of both their own paper but also their peers.
The learned presentation and communication skills are beneficial for future presentations both in the industrial as well as scientific environment.

Machine learning enables extracting knowledge from data computationally and in an automatized way.
We will learn on examples how this is influencing the very scientific method.
Machine learning is a data analysis and computational tool that in the last two decades brought groundbreaking progress into many modern technologies.
What is more, machine learning is becoming an indispensable tool enabling progress in many scientific disciplines where knowledge is deduced from data.
This course will present some recent works in this direction.
In the first part of the course works of different EPFL laboratories that use machine learning to address scientific questions in physics, chemistry, material science and biology will be presented.

This lecture is accessible to all students across disciplines interested in natural and computational sciences.
This topics course focuses on recent and classical fundamental results on the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, such as global existence of weak solutions, (non)uniqueness results, blow-ups, partial regularity, anomalous dissipation.
The course regards the mathematical theory of the three-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.
It provides self-contained proofs of some of the most significant results in the area, many of which can only be found in research papers.
The first part of the course is dedicated to Elgindi's result on blow-up of solutions of 3D Euler.
The second part of the course, include a selection of topics between the following list:
the existence of global-in-time Leray-Hopf weak solutions for Navier-Stokes and the local existence of strong solutions;
the conditional local regularity results of Prodi-Serrin;
the partial regularity results of Caffarelli, Kohn, and Nirenberg;

The precisetopics will be decided together with the participants.
Each participant is expected to deliver an oral presentation accompanied by lecturenotes.
The course is about defining perfectoid spaces, and possibly presenting some applications.
Possible contents:1) valuations, the Riemann-Zairski space of a field, the valuation spectrum of a ring2) topological algebra3) adic spaces4) perfectoid algebras5) perfectoid spaces6) tilt of a perfectoid space
Analyzing data for a collaborator or client is very different from working on your own research project ;
not only do you need competences in statistics, you must also ensure good communication (both ways) in a multi-disciplinary environment, coordination of the work, and the management of everyone.
During this highly-participative course, we will discuss how to collaborate efficiently with non-statistical clients.
We will cover in particular the following topics:
Managing interactions with the client Understanding the client's situation, needs and expectations:
Adapting your way of interacting depending on the background, personality, and goals of your clients Managing expectations (including how to deliver bad news).
Performing efficient and professional statistical consulting Tips and tricks, traps to avoid Effectively conducting the statistical analysis The statistical issues most commonly encountered during consulting sessions.
Ethics and legal questions:
data access, protection and retention;
reproducibility;
responsibility;
authorships;
etc.
Useful tools to facilitate efficient consulting work Delivering and communicating the results Writing reports Using tables, figures, graphs to communicate summaries of data and results Designing efficient data visualizations Explaining technical terms and concepts to a non-specialized audience Communicating common types of statistical results (p-values, risks, probabilities, etc.).
Additional topics of discussion can also be added depending on the interest of the participants.
In particular, an optional discussion could take place on the different possible administrative frameworks for providing statistical consulting:
freelancing, self-employed, creating a company, etc., as well as topics such as invoicing.
The course will alternate between presentations (with discussions and questions) and practice of simulated consulting sessions.
Participants will discuss statistical issues based on provided documents, but they will not need to perform actual data analyses during the course.
Evaluation:
Credits for the course are obtained by active participation in the discussions and simulated consulting sessions, and in addition based on a statistical report oriented towards a specified client.
The aim of this course is to learn about lattice gauge theories, but also a bit about their (potential) continuum limits.
The aim of this course is to learn about lattice gauge theories, but also a bit about their (potential) continuum limits.
In particular, we will be curious about understanding why construction of 4D Yang-Mills might be difficult and we will see that even more basic questions remain unanswered.
The first part will be in the lecture format and we will restrict ourselves to simple classical results.
In the second half of the course we try to peak a bit into the contemporary research, possibly also via participative presentations.
We will most likely start off by a reminder of spin models on the lattice with global symmetries and then see what happens when we consider local symmetries instead.
The lecturer is no expert in the domain and is looking forward to exploring the topic with you!
The course will provide the students the skills to use simple notions in linear algebra such as rank, dimension, vector space, eigen values,tensor product, and matrices to solve seemingly accessible problems that may be quite natural and "elementary" and yet are difficult to solve by other methods.

The course covers topics in multiplicative number theory, such as classical theorems on mean -values of multiplicative functions and the more modern developments involving averages in short intervals, the Chowla conjecture and the local uniformity conjecture for the Liouville function.
We will discuss asymptotic behaviour of expressions involving multiplicative functions.
We start with the simplest topic on how to determine the average value of a multiplicative function, using both elementary and more powerful complex analytic tools, culminating in Halasz's theorem.
Following up on that, we investigate the notorious Chowla conjecture which concerns self-correlations of the Möbius (and the closely related Liouville function) and which is a version of the heuristic that the multiplicative structures of consecutive integers are independent.
We will discuss about some recent progress towards this conjecture.
Topics that will be covered in the course:
a) Mean values of multiplicative functions, Dirichlet series b) Distances of multiplicative functions, Wirsing's theorem and Halasz's theorem c) Multiplicative functions in short intervals:
the theorem of Matomäki-Radziwill d) Applications of the Matomäki-Radziwill theorem:
the logarithmic Chowla and Elliott conjectures for 2-point correlations.
e) The local uniformity conjecture for the Liouville function e) Some connections with dynamical systems, Sarnak's conjecture and some applications of multiplicative number theory to Ramsey theoretic problems.
The lecturer is not a leading expert and will be happy to explore the topics with the participants.

This course introduces advanced fabrication methods enabling the manufacturing of novel micro- and nanosystems (NEMS/MEMS).
Both top-down techniques (lithography, stenciling, scanning probes, additive techniques) and bottom-up approaches (self-assembly) are presented.
The course aims to present the most advanced micro and nanofabrication methods that go beyond the well-established techniques typically used for e.g., CMOS technologies, such as lithography and thin film processing.
Many of these new methods are emerging but have the potential to play an important role in future versatile nano-manufacturing.
It is thus useful for PhD students to be aware of them in order to design and fabricate novel micro- and nanosystems, by involving new functional materials and by achieving resolutions, shape and throughput that are of importance for the target applications.
The course will cover techniques that are on the one hand used as rapid prototyping and on the other hand also scalable methods for high-throughput manufacturing.
The list of topics that will be described in the course is shown below.
The topics will be updated from time to time to address also the most relevant and timely issues related to advanced micro- and nanomanufacturing.
Guest Professors who are among the leading scientists in their respective domains will contribute to the lectures and share first-hand experience with the students.
In this edition, the following three international experts have confirmed to take part:
Prof.
Massimo Mastrangeli (TU Delft, NL) Prof.
Francesc Perez-Murano (CNM Barcelona, E) Prof.
Karl Bohringer (U-Washington, USA) List of topics:
Top-down fabrication:
a) Advanced lithography recapitulation, b) nano-fabrication through stencils, c) micro/nano printing methods, d) (thermal) scanning probe lithography Bottom-up fabrication:
a) principles of self-assembly, b) capillary self-assembly, c) fluidic self-assembly, d) capillary assembly of nanoparticles, e) directed self-assembly The course will be given in a flipped classroom approach to make the best use of the presence of the teachers on EPFL campus and for dedicated classroom lectures.
A precise schedule will be set up that will cover a total of about 6 weeks.
It entails that the PhD students will get some reading/work assignment before the actual in-classroom lectures.
Phase I:
Introduction lecture online from each teacher (duration:
8h, ~4-5 weeks before classroom lessons) Phase II:
group-of-4 formation, reading assignment, group project definition and preparation (duration:
4-5 weeks) Phase III:
in-class advanced lectures by teachers (12h in 2-3 days within 1 week) Phase IV:
group project presentations + discussion and feedback (6h) The course starts by presenting an overview of currently available options for fabricating micro- and nanosystems, which includes both established techniques (electron beam lithography, nano-imprint lithography), covered in prior courses, and non-standard or advanced ones.
This provides a recapitulative bridge to the students' background before focusing on the core of the course, which is the latter techniques.
We then proceed by introducing the advanced techniques in details, e.g., focused ion beam (FIB) induced fabrication of nanostructures and nanodevices and thermal scanning probe lithography (t-SPL).
For each technique, a brief overview about history and background theory is provided, before focusing on recent developments and applications.
For each technique the respective advantages, limitations and complementarities are discussed.
The second part of the course covers bottom-up methods and focuses on techniques that rely on the contactless and/or unsupervised placement of micro- or nanocomponents within a pre-existing templating substrate, i.e., where the structure arises from the directed organization of the constituting components - a family of approaches that can be broadly defined as "self-assembly".
A theoretical framework inspired by equilibrium thermodynamics is briefly presented, before exemplifying three main applications within this family, namely:
the integration of 2D microelectronic systems and self-folding of 3D MEMS by capillary self-alignment, the fluidic self-assembly of 3D systems including polymeric, liquid-filled microcapsules, and the topographically-templated capillary assembly of nanoparticles.
Another topic of the course is a combination of top-down and bottom-up using directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers.
It is emerging as a suitable possibility for high volume manufacturing of nanostructures and nanodevices.
It is strongly being considered as a complementary nanopatterning technique in the roadmaps of the semiconductor industry and has been added, removed and then re-added to the ITRS (now IRDS) roadmaps.
DSA takes advantage of the properties of block co-polymers to self-assembly, resulting in patterns with characteristic dimensions determined by the size of the molecules.
In this way, resolution is only dictated by the molecular weight.
The main aspects of state-of-the art DSA will be presented including:
materials, processing details, kinetics of self-assembly and applications.
Special attention will be devoted to the creation of the guiding patterns that allows to position and orient the molecules in the correct position.

It's all about the lipids:
We use a chemical biology approach to answer outstanding questions in membrane biology.
We show you how to use our lipid tools that allow you to manipulate lipid concentrations and visualize them in cells.
Lipids are essential for cellular functions and signaling processes.
Yet, they are understudied compared to other biological molecules such as proteins, mainly due to a lack of appropriate methodology.
Compared to proteins, it is very difficult to introduce perturbations such as concentration changes and it is further very challenging to visualize lipids especially in a cellular context.
This has mainly to do with both the size and also the chemical diversity of lipids.
Chemical biology approaches such as the introduction of photolabile moieties, photocrosslinking and click chemistry groups offer the possibility to fill this methodological gap and in particular to address biological questions on the level of individual lipid species.
In this course, we will show the students the different methods we use to modulate and visualize lipids in the cell.
The students will get practical experience in (i) how to cultivate diverse bacteria (ii) how to treat them with antibiotics or (iii) with bacteriophages that they will isolate themselves from the environment.
Over the last century, antibiotics have been one of the main pillars of modern medicine and have considerably contributed to the increase of our life expectancy.
However, their overuse combined to the rapid adaptation power of bacteria has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and to health issues associated with their impact on the human gut microbiota.In parallel, because of the lack of economic incentive, the private sector has strongly reduced its efforts in antibiotic research and development.
There is therefore an urgent need to find alternative paths to target bacterial pathogens.Bacteriophages (or phages) are viruses that infect and replicate within bacterial cells.
Because of their capacity to kill bacteria, phages have started to be used as antimicrobials about a century ago, but this rapidly collapsed when the first antibiotics were discovered.
In the western world, phage therapy is currently going through a revival because of the antibiotic crisis, but is only used in compassionate-use interventions, when antibiotics are no longer working.In this practical, the students will learn the basic techniques needed to work with antibiotics and phages in a classical microbiology lab.

Cancer biology thereby brings together multiple scientific disciplines, including cell- and molecular biology, biochemistry, pharmacology and various disciplines of medicine.
We have recently established the 'John and Lola Grace Distinguished Cancer Lecture Series' and we have been able to attract world-leading cancer researchers to come to EPFL.
All invitees have been competitively selected based on scientific excellence and impact of the research on improvement of care for cancer patients.
The PhD students attending this course will meet the day before the Distinguished Cancer Lecture Series with the speaker and/or an ISREC Faculty member to get an introduction to the particular field of the lecturer and discuss 2-3 high-impact key publications of the speakers' field (2 hours).
The students will then attend the lecture of the distinguished speaker (1 hour) and will afterwards have the exclusive opportunity to discuss open issues from the lecture, ethical and economical implications, as well as to get a unique insight into critical career decisions of the lecturer and get personal advice on the students' own career planning (1 hour).
All the information are available on this link https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/isrec/swiss-institute-for-experimental-cancer-research/lola-and-john-grace-cancer-research-lectures/ .

It takes place yearly from Sept./October to December & intends to teach image processing with a strong emphasis of applications in life sciences.
The idea is to enable the participants to solve image-processing questions via workflows independently.
Over the last decades, the images arising from microscopes in Life Sciences went from being a qualitative support of scientific evidence to a quantitative resource.
To obtain good quality data from digital images, be it from a photograph of a Western blot, a TEM slice or a multi-channel confocal time-lapse stack, scientists must understand the underlying processes leading to the extracted information.
Of similar importance is the software used to obtain the data.
To expose participants to translational biomedical research (from bench to bedside and back) and drug discovery.
Through a logical series of presentations both from the participants and the lecturer (flipped classroom format, oral presentations, workshops) on the making of an innovative medicine, the entire and complex process starting from the therapeutic target identification up until the clinical development and use in clinical practice of a new molecular entity (NME) will be addressed and discussed.

This course introduces the theory and application of modern convex optimization from an engineering perspective.
Convex optimization is a fundamental branch of applied mathematics that has applications in almost all areas of engineering, the basic sciences and economics.
For example, it is not possible to fully understand support vector machines in statistical learning, nodal pricing in electricity markets, the fundamental welfare theorems in economics, or Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games without understanding the duality theory of convex optimization.
The course primarily focuses on techniques for formulating decision problems as convex optimization models that can be solved with existing software tools.
The exact formulation of an optimization model often determines whether the model can be solved within seconds or only within days, and whether it can be solved for ten variables or up to 10^6 variables.
The course does not address optimization algorithms but covers the theory that is necessary to follow advanced courses on algorithm design such as EE-556:

Over the past decade, supply chain management has drawn enormous attention by industry and academia alike.
Given an increasingly global economy, pronounced trends towards outsourcing and advances in information technology, more and more complex business relationships among companies have evolve When taken together with market pressures such as rapidly changing product life cycles, proliferation of product variety, and co-existence multiple distribution channels, supply chain management today is rightfully seen as a new competitive imperative.
While industry is making tremendous progress in experimenting with new and innovative ways to manage their supply chains, we are beginning to see widespread interests to better inform supply chain choices by careful analysis of impeded tradeoffs.
In this seminar, we will provide an overview of the state-of-the art in supply chain modeling and study select research papers on this topic.
We will draw on the understanding and experience of industrial practices to illustrate key tradeoffs.
The resulting mathematical models are used to foster managerial insights and prescribe optimal courses of actions.
This course covers recent research and advances in operations and supply chain management.
The objective is to familiarize Ph.D.
students with the latest research in these areas and to provide for an opportunity to common modeling assumptions.
The course should be of particular interest for students who are currently pursuing doctoral studies at the junction of technology management and supply chain management, or related fields.
In addition, it should appeal to students who are interested in the quantitative analysis of operations and supply chains.
This course presents a first introduction to microeconomic theory and its applications.

This lecture presents ongoing work on how scientific questions can be tackled using machine learning.
Machine learning enables extracting knowledge from data computationally and in an automatized way.
We will learn on examples how this is influencing the very scientific method.
Machine learning is a data analysis and computational tool that in the last two decades brought groundbreaking progress into many modern technologies.
What is more, machine learning is becoming an indispensable tool enabling progress in many scientific disciplines where knowledge is deduced from data.
This course will present some recent works in this direction.
In the first part of the course works of different EPFL laboratories that use machine learning to address scientific questions in physics, chemistry, material science and biology will be presented.
Professors involved include:
Lenka Zdeborova, Giuseppe Carleo, Michele Ceriotti, Philippe Schwaller, Alexander Mathis, Anne-Florence Bitbol, David Harvey.
Examples of problems covered include neural-network enhanced solutions of the Schrodinger equation in a variety of contexts, machine learning for the prediction and rationalization of chemical and physical properties of materials, analysis of proteins from their sequence and structure, or automated data analysis and modeling brain-function in neuroscience, application in astrophysics.

Prior basic notions of machine learning are required, any of the introductory courses to machine learning is suitable.
This lecture is accessible to all students across disciplines interested in natural and computational sciences.
This course is neither an introduction to the mathematics of statistics nor an introduction to a statistics program such as R.

The goal of the course is to guide students through the essential aspects of molecular neuroscience and neurodegenerative diseases.
The student will gain the ability to dissect the molecular basis of disease in the nervous system in order to begin to understand and identify therapeutic strategies.

This course focuses on the biophysical mechanisms of mammalian brain function.
We will describe how neurons communicate through synaptic transmission in order to process sensory information ultimately leading to motor behavior.
The brain processes information through the concerted activity of many neurons, which communicate with each other through synapses organised in highly dynamic networks.
The first goal of this course is to gain a detailed understanding of the structure and function of the fundamental building blocks of the brain, its synapses and neurons.
In considering this goal, we will also examine some basic methods including cellular electrophysiology and optical imaging.
This will enable the student to critically evaluate how neurons are studied.
The second goal is to learn how synaptic input is integrated and processed in single neurons based on the active and passive properties of axons and dendrites.
Students will assemble their knowledge of synapses and neurons into a coherent picture of neuronal network function, with specific emphasis on the interactions of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons, plasticity and neuromodulation.
The third goal, will be to place neuronal networks in the context of how they contribute to associative learning and sensory processing ultimately leading to behavioural decisions and motor output.
These topics will be examined during Week 9 of the semester in a written exam.
In the second part of the semester, students will carry out a miniproject analysing a neurophysiological dataset.
Each student must submit their miniproject report by the last Friday of the semester.
We will cover the following specific topics:
Passive neuronal membrane properties;
Excitability;
Synaptic transmission;
Glutamatergic synapses;
GABAergic synapses;
Dendritic integration;
Synaptic plasticity;
In vivo recordings;
Sensorimotor integration;
Sensory perception;
Learning
The goal is to guide students into the essential topics of Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience.
The challenge for the student in this course is to integrate the diverse knowledge acquired from those levels of analysis into a more or less coherent understanding of brain structure and function.

Planning Your Scientific Journey:
Being successful as a scientist requires more than acquiring knowledge and developing experimental skills.
It also requires:
(1) asking a good scientific question, (2) establishing a clear plan of action, and (3) seeking advice along the way.
The course entails a small group of students watching the on-line videos made by scientists, then doing written exercises, and finally discussing these exercises and videos with the course moderator.
It should take ~3 hrs per week for 6 weeks.

This course shows students how the physical principles of conservation, symmetry, and locality influence the dynamics of living organisms at the molecular and cellular level.
Computer simulations are used to explore examples of cellular dynamics and phase transitions.
Learning outcomes:
Justify selected molecular simulation techniques a for simulating cellular processes;
solve simplified dynamical models relevant to a cell;
explain how symmery affects cellular dynamics This course aims to show how the principles of symmetry and conservation are used by a cell in carrying out its functions.
We will examine selected cellular structures and dynamical processes and construct computational models of them that are solved analytically, numerically or with computer simulations.
The importance of dimensionality is illustrated by examining random walks in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions and two-dimensional fluid membranes that surround many cellular organelles and form the plasma membrane.
The symmetry of a system usually changes when passing through a phase transition, and it is increasingly accepted that cells manipulate the phase behaviour of intrinsically-disordered proteins in the cytoplasm to create membraneless organelles.
These organelles, which are also referred to as biomolecular condensates, carry out vital functions for the cell, but are also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
They are three-dimensional, fluid networks formed by a process of liquid-liquid phase separation, and exhibit quite distinct structures and dynamics that are controlled by the thermodynamic properties of their constituent proteins within the crowded environment of the cytosol.
We will construct models of IDPs and use simulations to quantitatively connect the structural properties of IDPs to the physical chemical properties of the condensates.
Computer simulations are used to explore model systems in homework problems and a semester project.
The primary goal of the course is to show students how nature uses symmetry and conservation to achieve specific cellular goals, and to understand how computer simulations can be used to study these processes.

In this class, I will give examples of phenomena in condensed matter physics that have a topological origin.
I will use the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for polyacetylene as the simplest fermionic Hamiltonian that ties concepts such as the index theorem, solitons, topological band insulator, the bulk-edge correspondence, quantum anomalies, and quantum pumping.
I will use the frustrated quantun spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic XYZ chain as the simplest Hamiltonian hosting continuous phase transitions that evade the Landau paradigm for phase transitions.
Other quantum spin Hamiltonians on a chain will be used to introduce the concept of symmetry protected topological phases.
If times allow, I will present the quantum spin-1/2 Kitaev Hamiltonian on a honeycomb and variant thereof to construct quantum spin liquids supporting topological order.
Topics covered:
Superfluidity in weakly interacting Bose gas, the random phase approximation to the Coulomb interaction in the Jellium model, superconductivity within the random phase approximation, the renormalization group analysis of non-linear-sigma models, the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.
In this class I will show, by examples, how field theory can describe some important phenomena in condensed matter physics.
The transition from a discrete to a continuum description is illustrated with the one-dimensional Harmonic chain both in classical and quantum mechanics.
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is introduced with the phenomenon of superfluidity for a weakly interacting Bose gas.
This is followed with the study of classical non-linear-sigma models and how to treat then using renormalization-group methods.

Neutron and X-ray scattering are some of the most powerful and versatile experimental methods to study the structure and dynamics of materials on the atomic scale.
This course covers basic theory, instrumentation and scientific applications of these experimental methods.
The application of neutron and X-ray scattering spans from crystalline matter to bio-materials and engineering, including fields like magnetism and superconductivity.
Similar to the vast possibilities with X-rays at synchrotron facilities like the Swiss Light Source at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland, the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, neutron scattering is a large-scale-facility technique with neutron sources among others at PSI in Switzerland, the Institute Laue-Langevin in Grenoble and a new joint European Spallation Source under construction in Sweden.

This course covers the statistical physics approach to computer science problems, with an emphasis on heuristic & rigorous mathematical technics, ranging from graph theory and constraint satisfaction to inference to machine learning, neural networks and statitics.
Powerful Mathematical techniques from statistical physics and spin glass theory have been applied with increasing success on various problems ranging from computer science, statistics to machine learning.
In the last decades, in particular, there has been increasing convergence of interest and methods between theoretical physics and much theoretical and applied work in statistical physics and computer science has relied on the use of message-passing algorithms and their connection to the statistical physics of glasses and spin glasses.This course will cover this rich and active interdisciplinary research landscape.
A particular emphasis will be given to high-dimensional problems.
Indeed modern data analysis uses complex statistical models with massive numbers of parameters In some cases, the high-dimensional limit is analogous to the "thermodynamic limit" of a certain (disordered) statistical mechanics system.
Building on mathematical ideas from the mean-field theory of disordered systems, exact asymptotic can thus be computed for high-dimensional problems.
We shall discuss examples in statistics, coding theory, and machine learning.
While the course is designed to be a follow up of PHYS-512, it is also intendeded to stand on its own, and to be accessible to mathematically-minded graduate students and researchers from engineering, computer science and mathematics disciplines with a knowledge of probability and analysis.
The course is aimed at theory-minded students, interested in the use of powerful methods originating in statistical physics, and their connection to open problems in modern high-dimensional statistics, computer science and machine learning.

Learn the concepts, tools and API's that are needed to debug, test, optimize and parallelize a scientific application on a cluster from an existing code or from scratch.
Both OpenMP (shared memory) and MPI (distributed memory) paradigms are presented and experimented.
Students are asked to bring their own computer.
This course is a two weeks long course open to all the PhD students with a basic background in programming.
The lecture examples and exercises will be provided in simple C++, but could also be provided in C or Fortran if needs be.
The project will be done in one of the languages supporting the concepts presented during the class, e.g.
C, C++, Fortran, Python.
The first week is dedicated to the theoretical concepts and practical sessions lead by teaching assistants.
Starting with the concepts of the hardware of one node of a cluster (memory hierarchy, instructions, networking, etc..), you will learn how to debug and optimize a sequential code to be run efficiently on one node of a cluster.
You will go through the entire Software Development Cycle loop (analyze, implement, debug, and test) using standard GNU and proprietary tools (gdb, valgrind, perf, Intel amplifier).
Secondly, the two standard industrial parallel paradigms targeting the shared and distributed memory models are introduced:
OpenMP (shared) and MPI (distributed).
You will learn the basic concepts of the parallel programming.
The goal is to learn how to choose the right paradigm for an application based on its needs.
The OpenMP standard will be presented in its 3.1 version (without the hardware targets nor the SIMD constructions) from the basic loop parallelization directives to the tasks concepts.
The MPI standard will be covered in details up to the standard 2 and some intersting concepts from version 3 will also be presented.
You will learn how to correctly use blocking and non-blocking point-to-point and collective communications as well as advanced datatypes, one-sided communications, dynamic process management and parallel I/O.
Throughout all the first week, we'll take practice the learned concepts by using a simple toy application:
a 1D Poisson solver (using a finite difference scheme).
From a fully bugged sequential implementation, you'll optimize it, parallelize it using OpenMP and MPI to come up finally with an optimized hybrid implementation of the same solver.
Please note that this course will not tackle the programming of accelerators such as GPU's.
The second week is dedicated to a personal project on your own (or provided) application.

This course introduces the theory and application of modern convex optimization from an engineering perspective.
Convex optimization is a fundamental branch of applied mathematics that has applications in almost all areas of engineering, the basic sciences and economics.
For example, it is not possible to fully understand support vector machines in statistical learning, nodal pricing in electricity markets, the fundamental welfare theorems in economics, or Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games without understanding the duality theory of convex optimization.
The course primarily focuses on techniques for formulating decision problems as convex optimization models that can be solved with existing software tools.
The exact formulation of an optimization model often determines whether the model can be solved within seconds or only within days, and whether it can be solved for ten variables or up to 10^6 variables.
The course does not address optimization algorithms but covers the theory that is necessary to follow advanced courses on algorithm design such as EE-556:

Wrap-Up
This course teaches the basic techniques, methodologies, and practical skills required to draw meaningful insights from a variety of data, with the help of the most acclaimed software tools in the data science world (pandas, scikit-learn, Spark, etc.) Thanks to modern software tools that allow to easily process and analyze data at scale, we are now able to extract invaluable insights from the vast amount of data generated daily.
As a result, both the business and scientific world are undergoing a revolution which is fueled by one of the most sought after job profiles:
the data scientist.
This course covers the fundamental steps of the data science pipeline:
Data wrangling Data acqusition (scraping, crawling, parsing, etc.) Data manipulation, array programming, dataframes The many sources of data problems (and how to fix them):
missing data, incorrect data, inconsistent representations Data quality testing with crowdsourcing Data interpretation Statistics in practice (distribution fitting, statistical significance, etc.) Working with "found data" (design of observational studies, regression analysis) Machine learning in practice (supervised and unsupervised, feature engineering, evaluation, etc.) Text mining:
preprocessing steps, vector space model, topic models Social network analysis (properties of real networks, working graph data, etc.) Data visualization Introduction to different plot types (1, 2, and 3 variables), layout best practices, network and geographical data Visualization to diagnose data problems, scaling visualization to large datasets, visualizing uncertain data Reporting Results reporting, infographics How to publish reproducible results The students will learn the techniques during the ex-cathedra lectures and will be introduced, in the lab sessions, to the software tools required to complete the homework assignments.
In parallel, the students will embark on a semester-long project, split in agile teams of 3-4 students.
In the project, students propose and execute meaningful analyses of a real-world dataset, which will require creativity and the application of the tools encountered in the course.
The outcome of this team effort will be a project portfolio that will be made public (and available as open source).
At the end of the semester, students will take a 3-hour final exam in a classroom with their own computer, where they will be asked to complete a data analysis pipeline (both with code and extensive comments) on a dataset they have never worked with before.
This course addresses the relationship between specific technological features and the learners' cognitive processes.
It also covers the methods and results of empirical studies:

Computer environments such as educational games, interactive simulations, and web services provide large amounts of data, which can be analyzed and serve as a basis for adaptation.
This course will cover the core methods of user modeling and personalization, with a focus on educational data.
The users of computer environments such as intelligent tutoring systems, interactive games, and web services are often very heterogeneous and therefore it is important to adapt to their specific needs and preferences.
This course will cover the core methods of adaptation and personalization, with a focus on educational data.
Specifically we will discuss approaches to the task of accurately modeling and predicting human behavior within a computer environment.
Furthermore, we we will also discuss data mining techniques with the goal to gain insights into human behavior.
We will cover the theories and methodologies underlying the current approaches and then also look into the most recent developments in the field.
Cycle of adaptation :
representation, prediction, intervention (e.g.
recommendation) Data Processing and Interpretation (missing data, feature transformations, distribution fitting) Performance evaluation (cross-validation, error measures, statistical significance, overfitting) Representation & Prediction (probabilistic graphical models, recurrent neural networks, logistic models, clustering-classification approaches) Recommendation (collaborative filtering, content-based recommendations, multi-armed bandits) Stealth Assessment (seemless detection of user traits) Multimodal analytics (represent & analyze data from non-traditional sources.
i.e.
sensors, classroom analytics, human-robot interaction)

Data collected through digital systems, such as online social networks, search engines, mobile phones, apps, etc., offer great opportunities for addressing important research questions about individual as well as collective human behavior.
Whereas such issues had previously been studied primarily by social scientists, the sheer size of modern social data sets, as well as the fact that they are produced within computational systems, requires computational ways of thinking about, and processing, them.
Moreover, such data is often messy and confounded, as it is collected from the real world taking its natural course, rather than under clean experimental conditions.
This makes it challenging to draw valid conclusions about cause and effect from such data, unless one proceeds carefully.
The goal of this seminar is to acquaint students with some of the fundamental questions and techniques arising in the context of computational social science, with a focus on research design and causal inference from messy data.
We will explore the above topics simultaneously in two ways:
We will read a textbook on causal inference for social science (most likely "Causal Inference:
The Mixtape" by Scott Cunningham, available online for free).
We will read research papers from computational social science that provide a deep dive into the topics discussed in the book.
Every week, we will focus on one portion of the book or on a research paper where the previous week's book materials are applied in practice.
All students will write a short summary and review of the respective materials, and one student will lead an in-class discussion.
Beyond familiarizing themselves with the methods and research questions in the field, students will become better at assessing and critiquing scholarly work (by discussing and reviewing papers).
Through this course, students will obtain an overview of the research designs and methods used in computational social science, and will encounter a series of papers based on them.
Moreover, they will increase their ability to summarize and critique scientific papers.

The students will understand the cognitive and social factors which affect learning - particularly in science and engineering.
They will be able to use social research techniques as part of the design process to understand end users.
General Aim:
To enable participants to understand the ways in which professionals learn their profession - with a particular focus on learning in scientific and engineering domains.
General Description of Material:The ability for individuals and organisations to learn is often regarded as central to their survival and success in the contemporary world.
But how do professionals (like engineers) learn their profession?
Learning is partially a psychological concept, but professionals operate in social contexts and so an understanding of professional learning also draws on sociological research.
Therefore understanding professional learning will involve a multi-disciplinary approach.
Plan of the course:Through exploring a number of types of studies on different aspects of learning, participants will build an understanding of concepts from learning sciences.
Students will also participate experiments to give them concrete experiences of adult learning in practice.
Alongside this, student will complete a simple educational design process so they will come to understand the techniques of pedagogical design.

General Description of Material:Learning is partially a psychological concept, but professionals operate in social contexts and so an understanding of professional learning also draws on sociological research.
Therefore understanding professional learning will involve a multi-disciplinary approach.
Learning is also messy - multiple difference concepts can apply in different ways at different times.
One way of deepening an understanding of the conceptual complexity of learning is to apply them to the real world through designing a tool that can be used to support learning.
You will need to work in a small team to design a learning object that will integrate concepts of ethics or sustainability into engineering education.
Plan of the course:Students will design a learning object in small diverse teams.
This will require carrying out a review of literature, generating ideas, making choices in situations where there is no perfect solution, developing and testing prototypes, and report writing.
It will also require working effectively in a team (managing communication, managing conflict, managing priroties and work distribution).
